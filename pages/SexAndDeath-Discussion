You can make sub-pages of this page. To do that, type in the phrase "SexAndDeath" followed by a dot followed by whatever you want the sub-page to be called — eg., SexAndDeath.Jason.needs.a.hair.cut. When you save your edit, the phrase will automatically be turned into a link to the new sub-page.

Hi All,
For those who might have missed the class on Wednesday, 21 February, I've got a pretty muffled recording you are welcome to listen to (with the volume on full, you can decipher most of it). Drop me an email and I'll send it to you.
Cheers

Hi all,
I just finished reading the handout that Jason gave us in the last lecture and found it intriguing, enlightening and also quite alarming. I've started a topic for it here:

SexAndDeath.Biology.As.Ideology.Reading

SexAndDeath.Backwards.Evolution?

Hi All,

I mentioned a recent New Scientist article (13 January 2007) on this subject in the last class. I'm scientifically naive, I admit, but to me the whole article seems to misinterpret evolution, and it disturbs me that an article like this has appeared in a "scientific" publication. Click on the above link if you want to read more. Of course, if you don't, don't.

SexAndDeath.Teleology.in.Biology

I have a lot of half-formed and probably misguided ideas on this topic, and I suppose that I've been skirting around the issue in other discussions. Perhaps I can be enlightened here.

SexAndDeath.Uniformity.Of.Life

Following the 14 Mar 07 discussion on normal or Gaussian distributions in biology, I had some ideas on it - anyone else's comments would be welcome.

SexAndDeath.Beginning.of.Life

Following the discussion on 15 Mar 07, I recalled a book by John L. Casti that gives a good brief outline of the theories of how life on Earth began - among many other interesting things. For more, follow the link.

SexAndDeath.symbiosis

Infact, dogs and people aren't commensal - the correct term is mutual. I've got the correct definitions for all the terms in the above link.
Sorry for the confusion.

Cheers,
Morgan
