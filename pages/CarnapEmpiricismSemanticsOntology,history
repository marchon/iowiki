- is Carnap's idea that framework choice is a matter of degree of any use to Bayesians?
- Carnap's point that "the restriction to rational coordinates would not be in conflict with any experimental knowledge we have" could be useful.  Are we restricted to only postulating the existence of the rationals under ..Quine-Putnam?  If so, must our proofs (if they are even possible/necessary under this conception of mathematics) also be undertaken with respect to this topology?  (I'm not sure if this would be highly problematic or not - I'd need to have a chat to some of the analysis guys if I really wanted to press this point.)
- is Carnap adopting a pragmatic approach to framework choice?
- if (externally) postulating the existence of abstract entities is meaningless, should all external existence statements be held as such (well, all external statements really)?

[[[break]]]added at line 15: *lime {code I'm not going to do a large summary of Carnap's argument here as I've already developed one from several of the other papers defending his idea from Quine's attack.  I'll just use this section to collect a few of the juicier ideas that may not have been emphasised in earlier summaries.

- Carnap is attempting to show that physicists and other scientists can use talk of abstract entities without any nominalist guilt.
-- This is because he believes the realist/nominalist debate is actually either trivial or nonsensical (depending on whether it occurs internal or external to a linguistic framework).

[[[break]]]added at line 0: *lime {code ----
*What is it?*

Carnap attempting to undermine the realism debate by showing ontological questions to be either trivial or devoid of cognitive content.

*Where can it be found?*

Carnap,R.; Empiricism, Semantics, and Ontology; Revue Internationale de Philosophie, Vol. 4 (1950), pp. 20 - 40

*How does it fit in for me?*

As has already been demonstrated in some of the other papers I've read (see Yablo.ontology for example), Carnap's basic idea can be used to undermine any attempt to draw ontological conclusions from linguistic analysis.  Such an attempt is fundamental to the ..Quine-Putnam indispensability argument.
