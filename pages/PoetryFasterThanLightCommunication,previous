My friend and I were talking about the feasibility of faster than light communication, and I thought it would be good to see what the Poetry hive mind thinks. Read on!

*orange Faster than light communication and hive minds...Is this a reference to the 'Ender's Game' saga?*

*red Hey I love that series! Especially Speaker for the Dead ... but all the books after that were crap*

*orange It's been a long time since I read them (I read 'Children of the mind' when it came out in 1997?), but my memory of the latter books is quite positive. I actually found 'Speaker for the Dead' to be the least interesting (unless we're counting the 'Shadow Saga' here - but I'm not, I just mean 'Ender's game', 'Speaker for the dead', 'Xenocide' and 'Children of the mind'). I found that the conceptual scope of the story to be a little mind boggling towards the end; I've actually been thinking of returning to it in light of the learning I've done in the interim - maybe then I'll discover why the above person (red writing) found the latter books crap, or we may just have differing tastes.*

*red The reson I liked Speaker for the Dead best of all, was because of the issues it took on: the way we treat people who aren;t like us, authority of people in chage (why are they in charge and should we accept it?) being able to think outside the square, and ... well a whole lot of other things that are hard to put into words. I started reading the others, but they were just boring typical science fiction, and didn't address the issues left from the last two books. They were just about spaceships, the military, technology, all the boring stuff that is in the typical science fiction book that makes it just like the rest of them. There should have been just a third book that dealt with the problems left by the last two. But instead he decided to waffle on and say nothing of interest in 1000 pages.*


Imagine a row of magic dominoes, each of which will fall over at the speed of light. When we tip over the first domino, the chain of collisions travels down the row.

Initially, there appears to be no problem. It's just like we sent a photon across the same distance. However, we actually arrive at the end faster than the photon. How much faster? When the last domino falls, we're ahead of the photon by a distance equal to sum of the width of all the dominoes.

So, the basic idea is that by banging objects against each other, _information is instantaneously conveyed from one end of an object to the other._ 

Now, you might think that any collision of object A traveling at speed S into object B will not result in object B moving at speed S, but at a fraction of S. That is, each domino will bleed off energy in each collision, slowing down the rate of communication. This may be true in some situations, but it definitely isn't for all of them. 

Behold, elastic collisions!
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_Collisions

Is _every_ perfectly elastic collision faster than light communication? If we have perfect, instantaneous kinetic energy transfer between two objects of equal mass, will information propagate instantaneously from one side of the object to another?
An example: http://en.wikipedia.decenturl.com/elastic-collision

We see things that look like elastic collisions all the time. I happen to see them a lot on the pool table, when a player hits the cue ball into the eight ball with such force that the cue ball stops dead and the eight ball carries on. However, my intuition is that force of the cue ball actually ripples through the eight ball as its molecules bump into each other, starting at the impacted side and traveling to the opposite side. This force propagation might occur slower than the speed of light. 

My friend's riposte is to consider a situation with elementary particles. Objects with mass (and thus volume), but no internal components to bump into each other. Now we're in murky waters. For one, we don't know yet if there really -are- elementary particles. Even if there were, however, I think the particle/wave duality may come into play here. If a particle is also a wave, it may be possible to think of it as a spring. If we hit one end of this spring, the totality of the spring will not just leap forward, but squish and extend into a new position, taking time. This analogy, however, may not reflect reality.

So, thoughts? Has all this been answered before?

*red I've seen this before, but in a simpler form: Take a long rod, of infinite stiffness, and poke somebody. Voila, instant communication.

This is kind of like saying the speed of sound is faster than light if the carrying material is dense enough ... which shouldn't happen. But I've always wondered, at the Big Bang, when everything was concentrated into a singularity ... wouldn't there then be infinite density, thus infinite speed of sound, since speed of sound is proportional in some way to the density (is it? not sure) so the speed of sound would be greater than the speed of light ... whcih can't hold true if relativity is still true, but it always is? So how does this problem get fixed? ... u4309050*

*pink I could be completely wrong here...but...
1. The atoms in the rod would exhibit length contraction, thus there would still be the speed of light delay in information travel. (yes/no?)
2. Isn't it that the laws of physics don't apply in a singularity? 
The speed of sound through a solid is definately related to the density of the material it is travelling through. I'll just pluck the speed of sound in a solid equation out of the physics textbook...v = sqrt(k/m)d
where v=velocity of propagation, k=the measure of the stiffness of the interatomic bond, m=mass of one atom of the substance, d=length of the interatomic bond (this is where density is important)

*red If the laws of physics didn't apply in a singularity, that would mean at that point in the universe's history, there were no laws of physics, but then why would the laws suddenly spring into being, just the way they were, at a point in time after the universe started? Surely they would have to be constant throughout the universe's history? If not, what could change the laws of physics that isn't a law itself? So the aforementioned problem is still a problem, I think. 

I know the rod problem can be solved but I don't remember how. Anyone care to try? ... u4309050*

                       *** 
To go along with Tegan's arguement and the idea that laws don't apply to a singularity...Im not sure if that is the case, but for the INITIAL SINGULARITY it may be safe to say that laws didn't exist...not saying that the laws haven't always existed in the universe's history...but that the singularity did. If indeed all the forces and all the dimensions were created during the big bang, then indeed time didn't exist before the big bang, and thus laws didn't exist before the big bang...but after the singularity exploded (i.e. the big bang), the universe existed, so then by logical conclusion, the singularity existed before the universe did, so perhaps the laws didn't apply to the initial singularity. 

*red Like I said, I can't see how this can be the case: when the universe was a singularity, it was still part of the timeline that the rest of the universe's history belonged to. So if the lasw of physics didn't exist then, what kind of divine force could cause laws to come into being when they didn't before? Things come into being because of laws that exist, have always existed and will always exist. A law can't come into being for no reason, unless it's the result of another law, but then that law will have always been. So the laws had to have applied in the singularity, unless someone can tell me what would make a law suddenly pop into being for no (apparent) reason.*


As for the rod problem, I'm prity sure that on a relativity level, nothing can travel faster than the speed of light, not even information. Thus, it could be observed for say, a space ship of significant length (half a light year for arguements sake) that if you fired the engines at the back, by compression the front wouldn't move straight away, but would only move when the compression wave indeed reached the bow of the ship! But thats relativity. Now lets look at quantum scales. Two electrons existing in the same system by definition must have opposite spin, if one electron is on one side of our solar system and the other is on the other, then by relativity it's going to take them a long time to get a conversation started...yet by quantum mechanical models, if we alter the spin of one of the electrons to match the electron on the other side of the solar system, then simultaneously to that event, the other electron will alter its spin to be opposite...instantaneous information transmission!!! It gets into really deep physics to understand that further (and by deep I mean almost no one can properly explain what the hell is going on!) but if it is true...I can see why Planck and Einstein hated each other so much!!!!!

*pink The definition of a singularity is a point of infinite density and infinite curvature of spece-time...Are you suggesting one singularity is different from another? Please see pp 133 "Brief History of Time" by Hawking. Personally my bet is on quantum theory getting rid of the idea of singularities all together.

Sorry, perhaps I shouldn't have phrased my views as questions rather than statements. I believe your rod problem is in fact solved once you take lorentz contraction into account.* 

*red The lorentz contraction only matters for things moving close to light speed, but the atoms in the rod could move at 1cm/hour if they liked and still make faster than light communication if they are close enough to each other.*  

*pink You also need to take into account relativity of simultanaeity. Relativity depends on reference frames, but just because an event occurs at a certain time in in one frame doesn't mean it occurs simultaneously at another.*

*red I think Greg's got it. The atoms can't be directly next to each other, and each bond is like a spring. I guess it's impossible to make the springs short and stiff enough that the compression wave travels faster that light. I think the problem was only if the atoms were very, very close to each other. I wonder if anyone with a chemistry background can explain (with maths if possible) why the bonds can't be short and stiff enough for the rod problem to be a problem?*

*pink If the bonds were that short and stiff, wouldn't the thing be infinitely dense?* 

*red That's what I was saying about the Big Bang - there would have been infinite density, thus infinite speed of sound. Also, I have come across loads of quotes in New Scientist saying that the laws of physics do indeed break down in a singularity - so I still don't understand how they just came into being after not being in being. Sigh. u4309050*

*pink [Quote, "So I still don't understand how they just came into being after not being in being] This could be entirely the wrong way to think about it...but... this is how I think of it...Think of a 3D graph of a sine wave (or similar - the function itself isn't that important atm) rotated about the x-axis 360 degrees...there are points where it shrinks to nothing and points where it reaches an absolute maximum (I guess this would use the big bang/big crunch idea) Things would get closer and closer to infinite density etc, reach that point of no laws and then expand outward again - you could do it backwards and the same thing would happen. By no means am I trying to say that this IS what happens! It's just a way of thinking about it so that the cycle of thinking about it keeps going
Tegan U4407565*

*red No, see what I mean is that when time exists there is ... stuff around, and that stuff has to be governed by laws. If the laws came into being after time had started, what was governing the stuff before then (in between time starting and the laws coming to be), and what made the laws* *change* *red to be how they are now, except another super-law, which governed the other laws? But then, why didn't it break down? Do you see?

It's like throwing a ball in the air. It changes speed, direction of movement etc, but all the changes are caused by one set of physics laws which never change, ever, during the whole thing. If the physics laws change after time has started like the movement of the ball, the movement can't be arbitrary, there has to be something governing it, i.e. a super-law (unchanging physics law in the ball example) which also has to pop into existence which requires another law for this to happen in, and forever it goes back ... ... u4309050*


*purple Perhaps we don't need a super-law, and perhaps the current laws don't break-down close to a singularity - it may be that there is an aspect of the current laws (not immediately obvious) that we've failed to consider, which would only be relevant (have a discernible effect on observations or outcomes of though-experiments) in conditions like those close to a singularity. So I'm suggesting the possibility that the laws/thoeries we have are good (not obviously inconsistent), but incomplete and there is simply an aspect we have overlooked which explains why our intuitions about the speed of sound in a singularity seem inconsistent with our beliefs about relativity and the speed of light. 

It seems that this could easily occur: 
If this 'addendum' had an easily observable/measurable effect, we'd probably be all over it - quantifying, characterising, amalgamating into theories. However if the addendum can only be discovered/invented when we consider the largely unobservable consequences it would have in conditions under which we can't exist (as far as I'm aware) such as a singularity; then it's not hard to see why it'd take a lot of though to tease it out. Perhaps we (people) haven't devoted enough though - or enough of the appropriate thought - to tease it out yet. Hamish*
