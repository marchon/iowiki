I was reading something on the SEP about scientific realism (http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-realism/) and I came upon this interesting point that Khun makes in relation to his discussion about the conflict between relativity and Newtonian mechanics. Khun claims that the two theories are incommensurable - due to their being characterized by slightly different conceptions of mass,  something that I think also relates to the effects of preconception on observation – and as a result cannot be evaluated in such a way that would allow a fair and equal comparison between the two. A fair and equal comparison between the two would of course be necessary if we were to rationally decide which theory is a closer approximation to the truth. The feeling I get from this idea is that khun seems to be claiming that both of these theories are just separate and incomparable pieces of cultural mysticism, and that the decision to accept one and discard the other is irrational because the theories are dealing with different entities. Something that seems blaringly obvious to me though is this: even if the two theories are incommensurable (which I think is controversial), couldn’t we still make the normative claim that the theory with the greater predictive power is better??? Surely such a rudimentary comparison isn’t plagued by the problem of incommensurability. This might be clearer if stated like this: I have two theories, T and T#, that are of a different class and make different explanatory statements about the world. However, theory T allows me to predict events, E, more accurately then T#, which can’t describe E to the same degree of accuracy. Now even if these two theories are completely incommensurable, can’t I still say that T is a better theory because it can make better predictions? (of course a tacit implication of this statement is that a theory is better if it can make better predictions – I think most people will accept this). Since the above seems to be the case for two completely different theories, I can imagine it would be even more valid a claim for theories describing similar situations, like Newtonian mechanics and relativity. Maybe Khun is pointing out that the problem with my statement resides in the meaning of E. Is he saying that E can never mean the same thing in two different theories?  Is this the incommensurability that means we can’t rationally decide between theories? Even if this is the case, it still seems sound to assume that a theory with a greater predictive capacity is a closer approximation to the truth than a theory with less. Although the two theories aren’t describing strictly the same phenomena, they are both making predictions about the physical world. Is this not enough common ground for us to make normative claims? What do other people think???

*red I think you are quite right Lorenzo. As it happens I was reading just that part of the book this morning and I was thinking the same thing.

Although apparently you can't make completely theory-free observations (as it says in the book), they can still be mostly independent, so one theory should be able to still predict better than another, the E can't really be incommensurable because that would imply you simply can't compare them. If one theory says we see things because our eyes sent out special rays, and another says we see things because light rays come from a source, then bounce off an object and into your eyes, the first will predict you can see things in the dark while the second says you can't. They both completely disagree about what light is and whether it even exists, but the second makes more correct predictions than does the first. So, I think in really, really "incommensurable" theories you can still evaluate which is better by looking at their respective predictive powers (the common ground here is the physical world which people from both theories have to co-inhabit) which is what you said (that "E" will always be a common ground for evaluating theories).... u4309050*

*blue Right.  The real problem (if there even is one) comes with even more incommensurable theories than you're thinking of, which say that we're doing the experiments wrong.  There may not be any theories like that at the moment, but there might be in the future.  Scientific revolutions which make us think we've been doing all our experiments wrong do happen.  Jason*

*red Do you mean two theories that have different ideas about science, so that if one makes a great, true prediction, the other will say that wasn't even a prediction at all?

Can you think of an example of theories like this?*
