}*[[[break]]]to: *green {code - The pragmatic need for existential quantification in no-causal situations implies 2 levels of ontological belief which again is a problem for the naturalist.
- And again, this position suffers from lacking justification for looking at linguistic frameworks in general from within the framework of science (of course science looks privileged from this perspective).
-- Thus ontological commitments made in this way are applicable only within the scientific linguistic framework.

[[[break]]]changed line 24 from: *orange {code _Thick and thin indispensability arguments_

}*[[[break]]]to: *green {code _The problem with thin indispensability arguments_
- Price points out that anyone who is willing to accept Colyvan's second premise (that mathematical entities are indispensable to our best scientific theories) is already committed to the existence of said entities under the Quinean program (unless on e distinguishes between scientific and ontological beliefs, which Quine would not want to do). Thus his argument is redundant in this positive sense.
- The indispensability argument may however be employed if one is attempting to defend against the anti-realist (if they didn't agree with the original Quinean program, it may be the case that they would be convinced by the indispensability argument).

- For the thesis it gives a sort of structured approach to criticisms of indispensibility: first to point out the problems with using it positively (i.e. tension between the thick version and naturalism and the vacuity of the thin version), and then to argue against it viability as a negative argument.
- For the metaphysics paper it gives a nice account of how the existential quantifier can be thought of as empty in terms of meaning.

- There are 2 versions of Quine's ontological program:
-- Thick: in which science used as evidence for ontological inference.
-- Thin: in which phil. complements sci by clarifying, interpreting and determining appropriate entity ranges.
- The thick version conflicts with Quine's naturalism in that it separates philosophy from science (ontology must be ..first-order in Quine's view).  Thus we need to go for the thin interpretation.
