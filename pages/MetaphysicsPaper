*What is it?*

Michael Dummett has proposed a significantly different ..anti-realist strategy involving the assessment of how we are to assertain the truth-values of sentences relating to subject matter generally claimed by the realist.  However, there seem be flaws in Dummett's method that effect the feasibility of its application in different areas.  It will be interesting to trace these further with a view to tracking exactly what it is in the nature of these different subject areas that causes the method to be applicable/inapplicable.

*Where can it be found?*

Dummett, Truth and Other Enigmas

Realism, Stanford Encyclopedia
----
*Next steps*
- Read Dummett's relevant chapters.
- Read Wright's introduction.
- Think some more about the (possibly) pragmatic aspects of what Dummett is trying to do.
