*red Here are two of my favourite HG Wells short stories too. Neither relate to the course but both are fantastic, Aepyornis Island http://www.online-literature.com/wellshg/1/ about a mans companionship with a gigantic bird on a deserted island, and The Truth About Pyecraft http://www.online-literature.com/wellshg/20/ about a man who discovers a magical potion which allows him to rapidly lose weight.

I raise the topic mainly because i read a very short story by Asimov called "the last question" this afternoon 
(http://www.multivax.com/last_question.html) which related to entropy, and how to reverse it.

Thoughts? Input? Abuse?
