*What is it?*

A page detailing the problem(s) that van Fraassen has with inference to the best explanation (especially in relation to any role it may play in justifying scientific realism).

*van Fraassen's Views*

_Sellars' Argument for Inferential Quality as Grounds for Realism_
Two statements:
-> 1."As I see it, to have good reason for holding a theory is ipso facto to have good reason for holding that the entities postulated by the theory exist."
-> 2. "We are always willing to believe that the theory which best explains the evidence, is empirically adequate."
-> The first, by Sellars, is an attempt to link IBE (as a commonly employed scientific technique) with a realist position.  The second, by van Fraassen, is an attempt to show that explanatory basis for scientific inference can be employed without the need to adopt a realist attitude towards scientific theories.

_Conditions for the Employment of the IBE Operator_
IBE can only be applied once one is committed to a belief in one of some set of competing hypotheses.  Hence, even if the realist can get from the application of IBE to realism, they first need some additional premiss to get one to the coice between competing hypotheses.  Van Fraassen postulates a candidate: "every universal regularity in nature needs an explanation."

_The Demand for Explanation_ (~Smart)
Arguments for realism that involve explanatory power as a criterion for theory choice only work if the demand for explanation is all-pervasive.  This demand leads to the need for some theory (or group of theories) at least to be view as "real" so that they can provide a sort of "bed rock" for explanation of other theories that one may want to adopt in an instrumental way.

For van Fraassen, the anti-realist's attitude to explanation differs in that he or she is willing to accept that the fact that data fit particular theories, is just that - a fact.  It does not have, nor does it require, some form of explanation.

- Mostly that I'm confused at this stage.  More reading is needed...
