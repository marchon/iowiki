*blue This is interesting, as NASA are currently in a large debate as to whether or not they should send humans to Mars, as they may infect the Martian landscape with Earth Bacteria (even though they are in suits - the suits are not sterile, as the astronauts must live with them on board the craft, then put them on for EVA).  This is currently a major philosophical issue amongst scientists.*
