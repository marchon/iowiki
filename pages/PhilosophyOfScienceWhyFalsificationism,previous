I have been struggling with the concept of Falsificationism for weeks (and have been too distracted with study to write anything about it until now!)

I feel the main reason I struggle with the concept of Falsificationism is because I view science as quite the opposite. It seems to be drilled into my head that scientists develop a hypothesis about some phenomenon or another, and then set out to test it. They produce results that either confirm or disconfirm their theory; hoping, of course, to find data which confirms their hypothesis. If I understand Falsificationism correctly, scientists would set out only to find data that disconfirms their hypothesis, rendering all work on their theory useless and a waste of time. Now, why would someone who has spend years (and money) developing a model or theory about one phenomenon proceed to spend more time trying to prove the development wrong by falsifying it? (Unless one scientist develops the theory and yet another is 'responsible' for finding data which goes against it?) This just does not make sense to me! I don't recall Jason telling us the general reaction from scientists to the idea of falsificationism...
                  -> *blue I don't think there is a general reaction. Why would there be? Some scientists have liked falsification very much. Some haven't. Jason* 

I have been able to accept or understand most of the other topics we have covered in the course (although some I feel need to be taken with a grain of salt) but I just cannot seem to see the value of Falisificationism. Is anyone able to convince me otherwise?

- One reason is that some people are thinking of a weak version of falsificationism, which says that we should try both to confirm _and_ to falsify our theories, but we should put a bit of extra welly into falsifying them in order to overcome our psychological biases which would otherwise lead us to find lots of confirming evidence for our theories and never seriously look for any disconfirming evidence at all.  This is very plausible, no?
-> This weak version of falsificationism is not Popper's version --- i.e., it's not the version we studied.  I don't know any philosophers who mean this weak version when they say ``falsificationism'', but there probably are some.
-> Some people confuse this weak version of falsificationism with Popper's strong version (they don't realise that they're different).
- Another reason is that some people think, for purely technical reasons, that confirmation simply isn't possible.  I wouldn't expect you to agree with that.  I certainly don't.  But it's an interesting issue, with arguments on both sides.  I can suggest plenty of things to read about it.  The only thing is that you have to be willing to read about statistics.  That's why I didn't discuss it in full in the course.
