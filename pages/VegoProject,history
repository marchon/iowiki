[[[break]]]changed line 1 from: *orange {code Vego meat is good because ...
}*[[[break]]]to: *green {code Will lab cultured meat ever take off as a culinarily (?) and economically viable alternative to killed meat?

Can lab grown meat be defensibly called 'vegetarian meat'?
Or more importantly, would it be ethically consistent for vegetarians to eat it?

Why do so many people go "er yuck that's disgusting" at the mention of lab grown meat but do not typically have a disgust response or other negative response to 'ordinary' meat, the animal suffering involved in growing and slaughtering meat, or associate 'ordinary' meat consumption with health risks?

These are some questions that I am planning to pursue as part of a broader study into the discourses of vegetarianism and food policy.

I would be very pleased to receive thoughts, references to relevant work, examples of texts that instantiate discussions of lab meat,
etc. You can post them here or send things to me at Alison.Moore@luddite.cst.usyd.edu.au

thanks!
