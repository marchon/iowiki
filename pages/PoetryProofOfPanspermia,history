I'm not very up to date on this: I'll ask Dayal about it.  Jason*

*green I'm sure I have heard that somewhere before, about "genetic building blocks having come from space". I think it was in relation to a possible reason why biologists haven't been able to create complex life "in a test-tube". I mention it because I don't read New Scientist, but the argument sounds really really familiar...Now if I could just remember...

[[[break]]]added at line 0: *lime {code Hi all,

I was reading my homepage, when i came across an article posing the idea that some biological material came form space, and i was wondering if we have any thoughts on this in relation to panspermia???
