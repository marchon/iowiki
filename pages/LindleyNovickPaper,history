What work is permutation doing here?  I assume that the joint probability distribution remains regardless of how you put together the units.

---> *fawn Usually, exchangeability is defined as follows: a sequence is exchangeable if it doesn't matter what order the members of the sequence happen in.  Typical example: a sequence of coin tosses.  Does that make more sense?  The problem with that definition is that it's tied to temporal sequences, which is unnecessarily restrictive.

---> I define it like this: Two or more observation opportunities are exchangeable iff we have the same information about them; and two or more observation outcomes A and B are exchangeable iff it does us no good, either before or after the fact, to distinguish between the outcome sequences <A, B> and <B, A>.  Exchangeability for events means one or the other of these according to context.  In all cases, assignments of exchangeability, when properly made, are relative to some specified purpose.

[[[break]]]added at line 0: *lime {code Great paper.  Helpful more for expressing ideas about exchangeability and external validity, than randomisation.

Main message: There is no unique anlysis of data---in order to make inferences you need to consider the unit you wish to make the inference about, and this requires consideration of exchangeability (or cause).

This seems to sit very well with Patrick Suppes hierarchy of models.  And also the idea that there are two different statistical questions happening: what do the data say about an assumed model; and which model do the data support.

Definition of exhangeability, p.47:A number n of units is termed exchangeable in X if the joint probability distribution p(X1, X2, X3 ... Xn) is invariant under permuation of the units.  A further unit is exhcangeable in X with the set if all (n +1) units are so excangeable.

What work is permutation doing here?  I assume that the joint probabilty distribution remains regardless of how you put together the units.

A link between exchangeability and Fisher's use of `population' and `subpopulation' is made.

p.51: `The contrast between the medial and agricultural examples shows that there can be no unique method of analysing the data of Table 2 [Simpson's Paradox].

p.53: ``The second point leads on from this, Mnay sciences are observation and not eexperimetnal:; sociology, for example.  IN these cases factors cannot always be selected in such a way that You expect no confounding.''

But you can get this assurance in controlled studies either (unknown confounders)!!

Same para p.53: ``Observational materials ar ethemselves inadequate in situations like this; some judgement of exchangeability is essential in such cases.  The possibility of stronger judgement of exchangeability in the case of designed experiments as against observational data is one way of accounting for the sueriority of the former type of data collection over the later.''

This raises some questions.  Does designed = randomised (I assume not).  Does this assume complete knowledge of the causal processes at play (I assume so---or, one would have to emphasise the `possibility' of stronger judgement of exchangeability).

p.56: ``Once it is recognised that inference involves the passage from a data set to a new unit, it is clear that there is no unique analysis of a data set; for it is possible to imagine two units, linked in quite different manners, to the set.
