[[[break]]]added at line 83: *lime {code --- *green A further point regarding the complications of this position just struck me: often there is more than one proof strategy that can be used.  Consider for example the epsilon-delta, sequence, and open set definitions of continuity.  If one is going to allow the existence of the entities posited in proofs, which of these constructions should be posited as real (or should they all)?  What happens in the (possible but maybe not extant) case that a proof has not been formulated in the all of the different ways, should the existence of the mathematical object imply the existence of all the possible proof entities even when they haven't yet been constructed mathematically?*

Possibly a more satisfactory version of the above argument may be constructed by positing the existence of only those entities that are indispensable to the fundamental character of a sci. theory?  In this way perhaps one could maintain a realist position with regard to sci. entities but not math. ones.  Of course, there may be some issues to do with how exactly one would go about determining whether or not an entity was indispensable to the fundamental character of a theory (although these seem surmountable at first anyway).

Furthermore, given the deductive nature of mathematics is one to posit  the existence of all the mathematical entities that are indispensable to the math. theory that is indispensable to a sci. one?  If so, then it seems that this must track back to the various original axioms and thus that one may be able to justify the existence of all mathematical entities on the basis of one math. theory's involvement in a sci. theory.

Indispensable := not eliminable _and_ theory resulting from elimination would be unattractive (in terms of empirical success, unifactory, power, simplicity, explanatory power, fertility, etc.).


*Criticisms*

_General_

- Parsons: doesn't account for obviousness of basic math statements.

- Kitcher: doesn't explain _why_ maths is indispensable.

[[[break]]]added at line 0: *lime {code *What it is*

An argument for the  existence of mathematical entities.

*The argument (Quine/Putnam)*

_P1_ We ought to have ontological commitment to all and only the entities that are indispensable to our best scientific theories.

_P2_ Mathematical entities are indispensable to our best scientific theories.

_C_ We ought to have ontological commitment to our best scientific theories.

_Note:_ Argument form is valid, thus need to  criticise premises and/or general unsatisfactory nature of argument (e.g. doesn't give satisfactory account of maths).

*P1*

Argued for on basis of _confirmational_ holism and naturalism.  Naturalism is used to justify the only part whereas holism is used to justify the all part (on basis that theories are confirmed/disconfirmed as wholes).
