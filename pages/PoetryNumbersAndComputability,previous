"Irregular Webcomic" is possibly my favorite webcomic. http://www.irregularwebcomic.net/ 

As many of his jokes are about science and esoteric history and linguistics, the author frequently annotates his strips. Today's lecture reminded me of one of his lengthiest annotations, which covers some of my favorite mathematical material, including the particulars of the number line: http://www.irregularwebcomic.net/1845.html
Anyone wanting to get a bit deeper into today's material, or at least have get a different view on some of its elements, should find this useful.

The annotation is succinct enough for the material, though it's still long, given the complexity of the topic. He references a book by Hofstadter, an Indiana University professor. Anyone who is interested in _everything_ probably should read his book, "Godel, Escher, Bach."

*pink Absolutely.  Jason*  - *fawn Second that.*

*blue My dad made me read it when I was nine ... I liked the stories about the turtle and the other characters (the only one I remember was the hyperbolic race) but got swamped in between. Unfortunately I lost it so didn't get to read it when I was older :-(*

And for anyone wanting to explore webcomics, or just be well entertained, reading this webcomic from the beginning certainly couldn't hurt:http://irregularwebcomic.net/1.html
Like most webcomics, it starts out slow, then gets awesome :-)

*purple Jason mentioned that we _can_ talk about some interesting uncomputable numbers, but only very vaguely. One example of this is the halting probability (sometimes known as Chaitin's constant after the guy from IBM who invented it). Very roughly speaking, this number represents the probability that a randomly chosen computer program will terminate (as opposed to chugging on for all eternity). Of course, the definition depends on the particular program encoding that is used. Have a look at the Wikipedia article if you're interested: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaitin%27s_constant

*pink Cool.

I hadn't thought of this until now, but if there's no single thing which deserves to be called randomness (and I think there isn't, although that's a long story) then Chaitin's number depends on more than the particular program encoding, it also depends on the type of randomness used.

This pink clashes with the purple, I know, but I used pink above so I thought I'd better stick with it.

For those who may be interested in Chaitin and his number, he has written a very interesting book -  Chaitin, Gregory (2005), _Meta Maths: The Quest for Omega_, London: Atlantic Books - in which he tells the story of his discovery of his Omega number, along with a lot of other interesting stuff about about maths and logic.

For the electronically inclined, there's a review of this book at http://www.plus.maths.org.uk/issue37/reviews/book3/index.html

*black Sorry, but I have to say.... What do you mean pink clashes with purple?!?
It's beautiful! Look! Purple then a small amount of black and then pink, all on a white background! oooh I could stare at it all day! hahaha*
