[[[break]]]added at line 17: *lime {code I would suggest the author was not marking the decision to hang the horse shoe as lacking/poor/ignorant, but rather the lack of awareness by the individual hanging the horseshoe that the act of hanging the horseshoe demonstrated some degree of belief
in the superstition. Within the paragraph the indiviual denied being superstitious, while simultaneously accepting the possibility that the superstitious act may work. I would question wether you can not be superstitious while simultaneously accepting the possibility that the act will be the cause of a specific outcome. It would be a very unlucky person to not have some lucky occurrences in their life regardless of wether the horseshoe is there or not and attaching these events to the horseshoe would I suggest demonstrate superstitious beleif.

All that is required for hanging the horseshoe is the acceptance of the possibility that it might bring good luck, to the degree that the effort of hanging a horseshoe might not be unwarranted. As no-one has complete knowledge of the world, it would be somewhat arrogant to rule out the possibility completely. Viewing certainty of belief in such black or white terms is not connected with how most people view the world. When more realistic notions of belief in the gray areas are realised, it is quite possible to consider yourself as not superstitious, whilst still holding a small possibility that some superstitious actions work. In such a case, the notion that the 'good luck' that the horseshoe would provide will happen whether you believe it or not seems to be making a logical statement, that is, that reality is reality whether you believe it or not

Re: Page 3 last three sentences first paragraph and second paragraph

Blackburn suggests ‘we may not be aware of our ideas.’ He describes [an] idea as ‘a tendency to accept routes of thought and feeling that we may not recognize in ourselves, or even be able to articulate.’  The example he gives is of the individual performing the superstitious act of hanging a horseshoe on the wall.  I suggest the superstitious effect would be considered to be the bringing of good luck to the person or the building and what happens within. This individual says they are not superstitious, but goes on to claim the superstitious act works even if you don’t believe the superstitious effect the act is meant to yield. They appear ignorant of their own acceptance of the superstitious belief , in the act of hanging the horseshoe and in the statement that they believe the superstitious act works to make the superstitious effect happen even if the don’t believe in superstitious beliefs. When lack of awareness of the ideas behind an action in a situation where the variables are so few occurs so easily, it can begin to be understood how in the complicated ethical climate we live in where the number of variables are so many, peoples consciousness of what drives their decisions can be so lacking/poor/ignorant.
