Iain Lonie was once described as ``New Zealand's most troubling absence''---absent from virtually all the anthologies and from New Zealand itself for much of his life.  He was actually born in Cambridgeshire (in March of all places).  By trade he was a classical scholar, with a particular interest in Greek Medicine, and this took him to Cambridge at various times to study. [...]

He died in 1989, and his poetry is not going to be better known until something happens to make the NZ poets of his generation more fashionable.  The wheel will turn.
