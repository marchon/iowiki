Can someone post or transcribe the assignment here just in case I lose or have lost it?

---

Yes, I can. But you probably already knew that, considering you are me.

  Answer one of the following:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item What is theory of Continental Drip? What is the theory of
    Continental Drift? As far as possible, mention factors which
    also tell us something about other parts of science,
    \item Read the following two papers (available in lectures):
    \begin{enumerate}
    \renewcommand\labelenumi{(\Alph{enumii})}
      \item Peter Meese, Olga Vujovic, and Christopher Fairley,
      ``Randomised trial of a patient held record on the
      communication with general practitioners in patients with HIV
      infection'', \emph{Venereology} 1997; 10(4): 226-227, and
      \item Robin J MacGowan, Robert M Brackbill, Deborah L. Rugg,
      Nancy M Swanson, Beth Weinstein, Alfred Couchon, John Scibak,
      Susan Molde, Paul McLaughlin, Thomas Barker and Rich Voigt,
      ``Sex Drugs and HIV counseling and testing: a prospective
      study of behavior-change among methadone-maintenance clients
      in New England'', \emph{AIDS} 1997; 11: 229-235.
    \end{enumerate}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Briefly state the main conclusions of the studies
      reported in these two papers.
      \item Explain where each of these studies fits into an
      evidence hierarchy, for example the evidence hierarchy of the
      U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.
      \item Briefly discuss the evidence given for the main
      conclusions of the papers.
      \item To what extent are the conclusions justified by that
      evidence?
      \item What does this tell us about the evidence heierarchy?
      \item Does it tell us anything about the use of evidence in
      science more generally?
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Briefly describe some of the features shared by typical
    philosophers of science immediately prior to Thomas Kuhn's
    \emph{The Structure of Scientific Revolutions} (Chicago:
    University of Chicago Press, 1962). Briefly describe Kuhn's
    response to \emph{one} of these features. Was Kuhn right?
    Illustrate you answer with a scientific example.
    \item (Write your own question relevant to the topics covered in
    this course so far. If you take this option, you must have your
    question approved by the lecturer, in writing (including
    e-mail), by 5\,pm on Monday the 31st of March. If you have not
    received approval by then, you must answer one of the other
    questions. If you do receive approval, you must answer exactly
    the question which was approved.
  \end{enumerate}
  \paragraph{Rules}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Write up to 1500 words. Include an accurate word count.
    \item This assignment is worth 30\%\ of the marks for the
    course.
    \item This assignment is due by 4\,pm on Friday 11 April.
    \item Submit your assignment via the chute outside the School of

  it feels silly. It will make sure you don't lose marks by
