*Wittgenstein's Views*

There are several things that need to be looked at here.  First we need to define some aspects of Wittgenstein's later philosophy that will come into play.  Next, we need to look at his conception of traditional philosophy and how it comes to "discover" problems.  Finally we need to look at how Wittgenstein believes philosophical analysis should be undertaken

_Necessary Background_

- surface vs depth grammar
-- surface: way a word is used in a particular sentence
-- depth: actual uses of words under investigation
- language games
-- highlighting the diverse uses of language
- language as not bound by strict rules, as vague, as having no real essence
-- hence there is no essence to what it is to be a language game
- words as uniform in appearance but not application
- a proposition needs to be usable in order to make sense
- metaphysics: trying to express in language what can only be expressed by grammar
-- grammar is the apparatus, not the application of language

_Traditional Philosophy_

- the lack of success of the common sense approach (Moore) as motivating Witt
- problems of philosophy arise from superficially similar language games
- ordinary grammar does not give a clear view of our language
-- in particular it does not give a clear view of _use_
- the traditional philosopher as wanting to alter the ordinary uses of words (i.e. the rules of expression)
-- Lazerowitz: "to give utterance to a philosophical theory is not to use language to express a theory but it is only to create the false idea that a theory is being expressed."
- philosophical problems as result of a linguistic "muddle"
-- the way they are debated hinders rather than helps
--- *green problems for ..McD here?*
- trad phil as attempt to impose strict and clear rules (on all language games) where there should be none


_Wittgenstein's Approach_

- curing trad phil of its desire to attack common sense cannot be done with more common sense
- Hunter: grammatical expectations are raised by the examination of surface grammar and then tested against grammatical propositions resultant from looking at depth grammar
- description replaces explanation
- phil is not the search for truth
- phil investigation should never lead to criticism of a language game
- philosophy as therapy (offer resolution of anxieties (at least temporarily))
- everything we need to resolve phil problems is already available to us
- philosophy as "assembling reminders" in order to avoid relapse into anxiety
- W: "there is not _a_ philosophical method"
- linguistic analysis is still basis of investigation
-- just have a much wider conception of language now.
- philosophy should make traditional philosophical problems disappear ("leave everything as it is")
- there cannot be philosophical theories
-- *green in which sense of philosophical is this meant?  surely some theories can have therapeutic value?*
- looking for the source of philosophical anxieties


_Other Issues_

- problems with integrating with Witt.'s actual practice
- engagement in criticism of traditional philosophical views as providing "counterweights"
- movement from a largely logical positivist viewpoint in the Tractatus to a more pragmatist one in the Logical Investigations
- why should one venerate ordinary linguistic use, why can't phil be used to extend our language?
-- because trad phil does not extend any practice (of a language game), rather it abandons practice, thus stripping the terms in question of their meaning
- why can't we just view trad phil as just another sort of language game?
-- because the distinctive trad phil use of a word is just to remove it from such games
--- is this question begging?
- Fogelin: Witt. wasn't trying to give a complete historical account of trad phil, nor was he trying to give a new metaphilosophical account.  Primarily he was concerned with the dissolution of particular philosophical problems.  Along the way to doing this, he made some comments about the general method he was using _in those particular cases._
