Not as interesting, but free - do a google search for 'darwin's pond' - it is a piece of freeware where you can create creatures, and let them compete against each other

That's pretty cool! Not as fun, but maybe more interesting: it's certainly more about evolution than the former game!

Ok so let's make this page the page for random bits that are relevant but aren't philosophy.

I mentioned the crazy deep sea creatures filmed in the BBC documentary "The Blue Planet". The ANU library has the series, and after watching it all about four times, all I can say is DO IT. Not only super interesting and super-duper relevant to fleshing out an appreciation of development, ecology, evolution and some of the ways they interrelate (examples for our essays?), but also sublimely shot, edited, soundtracked and narrated. For me at least, nothing short of a religious experience.

Here's a Youtube clip ripped from it the beginning of the deepsea episode, the really crazy bit with the rediculous creatures. I'm sure the BBC doesn't mind...
