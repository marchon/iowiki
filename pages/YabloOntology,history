[[[break]]]added at line 37: *lime {code Indeed, Yablo argues that for the most part when we make statements, we are unsure as to whether they are strictly literally true or if they are at least in part to be taken metaphorically.  Thus the Quiniean must argue that in time these metaphorical parts of our statements will be eroded and eventually only the literal interpretation will remain.  However, this reduces the Quinean position to the following: one should   sympathise with the idea that Xs exist iff the literal part of theories involve their postulation _and_ one should count the part of a theory that involves the postulation of Xs literal iff there turn out to be Xs.  Thus there is a circularity.

- Carnap proposes a conception of linguistic practice (involving an internal/external distinction) under which ontological investigations cannot meaningfully be undertaken.
- Quine criticises this by linking it to the problems of the analytic/synthetic distinction.
- Yablo modifies Carnap's position so that the distinction is made on metaphorical/literal grounds in instead.
- This new position requires that the Quinean provide a principle of demarcation between metaphor and literal truth in order for their ontology to prevail.
- No such principle has been provided and so the Quinean ontological project fails.

Thus Yablo argues that there are two ways in which a statement may be interpreted: literally (external to a particular game or linguistic framework) or as a metaphor (internal).

_The Framework Strikes Back_
This distinction regarding the way in which a statement may be interpreted causes problems for the Quinean ontological regime.  Given that Quine does accept that assertions may be made in a metaphorical sense, and that when one does so no ontological implications may be drawn from such assertions, Quine needs to provide a clear demarcation criterion to distinguish between metaphorical and literal statements.  As this has been much discussed without progress, it seems unlikely that one will be able to distinguish between metaphorical and literal usage and thus it is impossible to construct a certain ontology under Quine's approach.

A paper critisising the Quinean view of ontology.  He does by introduces a metaphorical/literal distinction as to when it is reasonable to posit the existence of entities.  Thus in order to determine our ontological commitments we need to be able to extract all cases in which such entities are posited in a metaphorical way rather than a literal one.  If there is no way to do this, then it is not possible to develop a Quinean ontology.
