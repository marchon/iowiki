[[[break]]]added at line 68: *lime {code I see no reason to think that religion is a cultural domain where we are more likely to 'find' memes than elsewhere-- except in the sense that its easy to frame religion a meme that is 'good for' itself and not necessarily its carriers. But this is a result that is neither dependant on memetics, nor exclusive to it, nor is constrained to religion. If religion is just to be an example, then I see no reason why we can't just use another example. Of course there may be particular cases where religion is a particularly good example...
}*[[[break]]]added at line 69: *lime {code On the middle bit of the post, you've given a good example of how memetics has to talk about humans evaluating claims. But my problem was there normative, concerning the implications of this picture for precisely our making of such claims. "Just because a concept is carried by a meme, doesn’t mean the concept is incorrect.", you have your theist memeticist say. Of course. But it /does/ mean that any 'correctness' claimed for a concept must be seen as a meme finding a niche. But any meme that exists is to that extent in its niche. What then has happened to 'correctness'? Is it memetic fitness? Or is it also a meme? Certainly any theory of correctness we might appeal to is a meme; correctness as a judged property must be a property of memes. How do we say that it is more than that?
}*[[[break]]]added at line 70: *lime {code Early modern metaphysics starts from the certainty matter, but in turning to subjectivity it ends up essentially problematic. I can't help but think something similar is happening here, but now right inside our subjectivity. We start from the puportively valid claim, based on best material science, that memetics is a true material description of cultural activity, which includes making theoretical claims, and end up claiming just whatever the memes make us claim. 

That'd make a good t-shirt: "my memes made me do it".

So I guess you can guess that I don't think your claim that there isn't a meme about memes really holds. Because if memetics is (making you say that) memetics is true, then there is a meme meme, or a meme meme-complex, or however one wants to parse whatever is fighting for ground right now. 

:o

I must have stuff due.

I actually do agree with much what you've said, just that I don't think the way it's been framed gives much /scientific/ leverage on the 'in so far as's. But what I've typed out about it needs more thought than I thought it would. Be back...

Before I respond to Tom’s insightful posting, I think we need a definition of a meme.  Just to be sure we are talking about the same thing.  

Memes are the neural equivalent of genes.  But while genes are encoded by the four chemical base pairs of DNA, memes are encoded by neural nets composed of neurons, and their interconnecting axons and synapses.  From MRI studies of brain activity in response to certain stimuli, it does seem likely that conserved patterns of ‘circuitry’ exist in the brain.  To speculate then, it seems that this circuitry houses memes.  

Perhaps one day thoughts and memes shall be mapped to specific types of neural circuitry.  Perhaps, if the technology ever becomes truly great, we could upload or copy the circuitry (and hence the memes) via ‘brain scans’, as in science fiction stories such as Gibson’s ‘Neuromancer’.

Like genes, memes are supposed to be active germ-line replicators.  And certain kinds of idea do seem to encourage their own copying, and all ideas appear to be germ-line (Question – can anyone think of a ‘somatic’ idea?).  Lastly, some ideas do seem to be copied from brain to brain with the high fidelity characteristic of replicators – there is a whole branch of social machinery (of which teachers and education systems would seem to be a central part) dedicated to making sure ideas pass from parent to offspring correctly.

OK – now to respond to Tom’s posting.  Can memes be wielded in the name of atheism?  Perhaps.  They could certainly be wielded in the name of theism, if you wanted.  I imagine the argument (to play the devil’s advocate) would run like this:

“Just because a concept is carried by a meme, doesn’t mean the concept is incorrect.  In fact, if memes are supposed to be neural genes, their propagation must be governed by differential fitness, and the best way of being fit is to accurately represent the world (for the meme to be true!).  So…

-popular memes are fit memes, 
-fit memes are memes that are actually about something true,  
-lot of people share my meme about my religion, so my religion is the true one! Yay!  I declare the debate over and myself the winner!”

Of course, the counter argument is that like genes, the following could apply to memes:

-memes suffer from chance misfires of evolution, thus promoting an unfit meme
-memes may only be fit for given environments, not all environments
-memes offer just the best available option, not the best option theoretically *possible*
-just because a meme is common, doesn’t mean it is right – otherwise it is a bit like that ridiculous statement “more people can’t be wrong!”  Seen a mistake lately in wikipedia, anyone? 

I agree with Tom that it would be nice to keep religion out of the meme debate, but unfortunately above all else we need to first show that memes exist, and the most likely place (bar none) to find a meme would seem to be in religion.  I think the safest thing to say is that just because a concept is carried by a meme, that doesn’t 'necessarily' (although I don’t rule this out) tell us anything about the truth value of the concept. 

Next is a *really* important point.  Just as everything in biology is genetic, not everything in the mental realm is a meme.  Tom points out that you can appeal to indoctrination and so on without appealing to memes.  But indoctrination by itself isn’t a meme, any more than a codon is a gene.  An idea needs to be indoctrinated, have some incentive to cause the indoctrinee to teach the same idea to others, and they to others to qualify as a meme.  Sure, you could talk about this without mentioning the word ‘meme’, just as you could talk about genetics without ever mentioning the word ‘gene’.  But it is convenient short hand to do so.  In fact, isn’t there a theory in language that says very few words (about 64, and no, I am not making that up) are anything but convenient shorthand for combinations of those 64 other words.

This also answers the question “is every idea or mental state a meme?”.  No, it isn’t, in the same way a codon is not a gene.

The first thing I want to say is that I think wielding the concept for the sake of an atheistic crusade is not the best way to go about addressing the usefulness of the concept itself. Religion is a sensitive, controversial, and complicated topic and I can't see any reason as yet to think that it's particularly typical of culture in general. And anyway, one can talk about indoctrination and so on without appealing to meme concepts. Unless of course we want to say that all talk of socially learned belief is (can be usefully seen as) talk of memes. 

Do we want to say this? What makes a belief or norm or whatever memetic? 

Assuming we can give some account of the units, presumably in terms of mental content or functional states or something, is every such unit a meme? Say we restrict it to contents that are variable - being socially transmitted is I think not necessary, as memes can arise interact in one mind. We're then going to need to know what the non-variable structure is before we know anything useful about the content. This is something we do have in the case of genes. 

It is also illustrative of the problem of how the geno/phenotype distinction maps into memetics. Is the memotype the content, and its phenotype the behaviour? If we're talking about content in functional terms then this distinction doesn't hold.

Another problem is that the meme-enabling structure itself is going to be variable: developmentally, evolutionarily, and you're always going to have a hard time convincing some people that there even is a non-cultural substrate. At any rate, you will have to be able to delineate between memes structuring (making possible) other memes, and the whole thing being structured by whatever. And it's surely going to be the case that even the most 'primitive' of meme complexes are going to be built out of layers of differing complexities of content - perhaps there are some memes that are always socially learned and are necessary? Taking gene-culture co-evolution seriously means this would be expected.

The main problem with it as a theory is I think the specification of the unit. I don't think the problem of what memetics is supposed to explain is  really a problem at all - it's supposed to explain /how/ culture changes, what forces govern it, and so in that sense why it changes. The question is really whether and how such a model is going to tell us anything over and above what we already know about culture, or if we're going to be forever tuning our meme theories to meet them. 

I suspect the greatest explanatory gains are to be had at the thin edge of the wedge, where memetic evolution first starts to affect genetic...

Thoughts on any of the above? Disagree! I need to fashion a better handle on how to discuss this stuff...

Final thought, for anyone who's done Continental philosophy: doesn't the idea of ideas fighting in our minds sound just like Nietzsche's 'will to power'? His notion was indeed informed by evolutionary thinking, if insanely. Do we need to be worried about this? How do we validate the meme meme?
