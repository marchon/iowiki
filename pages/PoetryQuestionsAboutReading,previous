*blue Well due to the fact that in some respects am socially retarded and can't deal properly in group situations after coming home from my lecture I still didn't have answers to many questions I came up with while doing the reading.*

- When Physicists (or other scientists) set out to make a theory do they look at what already is known and then try to fit it in with what they have discovered? I know that in science a theory is never fully proved but that one can be disproved. *pink [Don't know that.  That's one of the things we'll be discussing and questioning.  Jason]*  So I was wondering is it ever the case that ideas are dismissed just because they differ from what is widely accepted as true even if in a sense it may not be? (*red Basically like the way Copernicus' ideas were dismissed because they went against the church does this happen today but in respect to science rather than religion?*)  *pink [Looks like you've got an example right there!  If so, that answers your question.  Any more examples?  Anyone?  Jason]*
 When Quantum mechanics was dismissed in the beginning ... then it and relativity took over Newtonian physics ... u4309050 *pink Good example.  More examples?  Jason*

When DNA was proposed as the coding language for genetic information it was poorly received because it only has four variants (nucleotides) as opposed to the more popular candidate; protein which has vastly more variants (amino acids) at >20. Hamish Ryan

* green If you want to read some controversial ideas about the way pet theories and personal bias can obstruct scientific endeavours then I recommend the brief piece I found today (18/03/08) at - http://zencomp.com/greatwisdom/ebud/ebdha264.htm

I am not in complete agreement with all the statements in this article, but I heartily approve of its theme (not necessarily its conclusion). I also like controversy which is part of my reason for suggesting it. A word of warning: This article doesn’t meet the typical credibility criteria of being ‘peer reviewed’ and found in a ‘reputable’ scientific journal. Nonetheless it should provide food for thought.

This article claims that non-rebirth/non-reincarnation has been disproved, but not accepted by the broader scientific (or lay) community. Hamish Ryan*



- When thinking about the topic of Branes in particular the following extract:

*fawn "Anything confined within a three-dimensional brane would look just the same as it would if the world were truly three dimensional. The other dimensions would exist adjacent to the brane, but things stuck to a three dimensional brane would never penetrate the higher dimensional bulk."*
   (*green page 96 of reading brick*)

I began to think that if a particle or body inside the brane were capable of conscious thought would they be able to fully comprehend the existence of the outside dimensions?
For example would it be the equivalent of a bead on the Abacus which can surely see the 3rd Dimension (even if it is confined to only two dimensions *fawn you mean one?*) or would it be like A..Square in flatland (who can't see the third dimension or comprehend it until he visits it)?
Or am I assuming incorrectly that the abacus can see the 3rd dimension (this is only the case if the abacus is capable of thought and seeing, I am quite aware that a bead on an abacus can't see at all)? *purple Maybe to exist in a dimension leads to seeing it and that you can only exist in a dimension by interacting with it.*

*Sam.Francis*

To see a dimension you have to be able to interact with it. An abacus bead can, it can rattle back and forth, so maybe not such a good example.
We can make 3D diagrams of 4D objects but we can't really imagine 4D. A 2D man can still imagine the 3rd D in a limited way ... cross sections, 2D diagrams of 3D objects .... u4309050
