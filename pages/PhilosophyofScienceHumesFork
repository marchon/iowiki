Would actually have had two tines. 

In Class Jason said ‘Hume would have had a 4 pronged fork’. As a part-time Cutlery historian I can tell you that the dominant British fork had only two tines up until around the times of the Napoleonic wars where three-tined forks become more popular. Four tines are a relatively modern invention.

Just in case you care...

*blue That's very interesting.  Thanks.

What I thought I said was not that Hume would have had a 4-pronged fork but that Hume's actual fork, which I had in the lecture, had 4 prongs.  Either way, I stand corrected.  I must have been sold a dud.

It might have been a paraphrased quote, sorry :)
