*purple There is an engineer, a physicist, a theoretical physicist, and philosopher are trekking a scottish mountain. They see a black sheep. 

The engineer says ‘wow, so they are black in scotland!’

The physicist qualifies ‘well, SOME sheep are black in scotland’

The theoretical physicist further qualifies ‘no, there is at LEAST one sheep that is black’

The philosopher even FURTHER qualifies: ‘well, he’s black on one side at least’*
