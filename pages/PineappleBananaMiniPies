Notes:
-  When I made these today I only had enough flour to make enough crust for 6 mini pies, which was fine since I was using a 6- cup cupcake pan. However, I *did* have some extra filling that wound up in the trash. It probably would’ve been enough to make at least 2 more cupcakes, so if you have an 8- cup pan, just adjust the amounts for the crust to make a couple more.
-  I used a *very* ripe banana… as in one that probably wouldn’t have lasted another day. I found that this made it easier to mix in with the filling, giving it a more even and creamy texture. I’m sure you could use one that was less- ripe but I can’t vouch for the texture
-  Use a silicone muffin pan. Usually, I much prefer metal pans, but as it turns out, silicone is much better for this recipe. As long as you grease the cups properly you’ll be able to pop these right out by gently pushing up on the bottom, allowing for crack- free removal. Yay!

- Recipe makes 6 mini pies- 
Preheat oven to 375 degrees

Filling Ingredients:
- 3 cups fresh pineapple chopped into small pieces (I used about ¾ of 1 whole medium- sized fruit)
-  1 cup very ripe banana cut into small pieces
- 1/2 cup flour
- 1/2 cup raw sugar
-  Juice of 1 small lime

Put pineapple, banana, and lime juice in a medium- sized bowl. Add flour and sugar and mix contents of bowl with your hands or a wooden spoon until well- mixed. If your banana is quite ripe, as mine was, you will wind up with a fairly creamy mixture (yum!).

Crust Ingredients:
- 2 cups flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/8 teaspoon salt
- ½ cup vegetable oil
- 5/8 cup water (sorry for this slightly odd amount, it comes from halving the previous recipe)

Mix dry ingredients well. Make a shallow well in the center and add oil and water. Mix gently without kneading until roughly uniform. Form into a ball and roll dough out into a large rectangle. Dough should be the right thickness for a normal pie (about ¼” ?). When the dough is flat and large enough, use a knife to divide the dough into 6 equally sized rectangles. You want these to be large enough to line a cupcake cup, so estimate accordingly.

After greasing the cups (I used vegan margarine), gently line each cup with one of the 6 dough rectangles. The corners will stick up a bit above the top of each cup. Spoon filling into each cup, since no top will be placed on these, fill them a bit above the level of the pan, or they’ll wind up looking too shallow.

When you’re done place into the heated oven and bake 25- 30 minutes or until the filling is bubbly and crust is golden. If you want, sprinkle some raw sugar on the top of each pie about 10 minutes before removing the pies from the oven to give them a bit of a glaze.

Remove from oven, cool and enjoy! The end result will be filled with creamy, delicious, almost- puddingy pineapple goodness. Yum!
