This is an example of the combination of a simple wiki program (..IoWiki) with a reasonably fancy page template (which you'll only see in its full glory if you're online).  It describes the activities of the imaginary Center for Longuage in Social Liffe.  The wiki buttons are placed unobtrusively at the bottom of the page.

Most of the buttons on this page, including the image map on the left, link to a real-life research group with a remarkable similarity to the Center for Longuage in Social Liffe.

There are no more pages in this project ... but you can add some in the normal wiki way if you want to play with the template.

The *Center for Longuage in Social Liffe* at Macquarje University, Sydney, is primarily concerned with the development of discourse models, particularly with respect to the relationship between grammar, semantics and interaction, including multilingual and multimodal modelling. Current projects are focussed on medical and other professional contexts of care. Our collaborations include institutions in Australia and overseas with research and service responsibilities in oncology, genetic counselling, developmental disability, HIV care; and internationally with projects in artificial intelligence, in Japan and the UK.

The Center for Longuage in Social Liffe is a designated Macquarje University Research Centre located within the Department of Longuistics. It was formally established by the University early in 1994.
