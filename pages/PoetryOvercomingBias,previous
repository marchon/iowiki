*green Definately a quote worth keeping!!!!
_Huve draws himself up with wounded dignity.  "You know, if my theory is wrong - and I do admit it might be wrong -"

"If?" says Nohr.  "Might?"

"If, I say, my theory is wrong," Huve continues, "then somewhere out there is another world where I am the famous physicist and you are the lone outcast!"_ TeganLarter*

*red Absolutely wonderful!  

I have to say, though, that I don't think that the description at the beginning of what Everett's theory was is right.  Although, as I said in lectures, there's a lot of disagreement about what Everett's theory actually was.  And there are various competing ways to make Everett's ideas work.
