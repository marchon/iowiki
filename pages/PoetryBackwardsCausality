Thinking about Backwards Causality and not being able to kill my grandmother in the past if she is alive now I began to think that if my actions now are 'affecting' my past self then wouldn't a future me be 'affecting' my present self? So reverse causality would be deterministic as anything I do now would be because of something I did in the future and just as I can't kill my grandmother my future is set.

Maybe I completely misunderstand this concept in which case you can either ignore me or tell me where I went wrong.

Something similar is drawn upon in "The Hundred Lightyear Diary" short story that Jason gave us - this mentions the possibilty of being able to change your actions (in a reverse causality world), although no-one ever does.  This could be similar to looking at our current situation, and saying that we are able to change our past, although no-one does.

Anyway, with that reading, I think I became a little confused, as it seems to introduce time as a cyclicle entity - writing messages and sending them to the past to be read by your future self - was this the implied message or did I miss it.
