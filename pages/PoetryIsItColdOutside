*blue There are many ways of checking the weather these days...

Look outside the window.
Watch the last 5 minutes of the news.
Look up the weather on the net.

*red The air air pressure made me giggle. Its so rediculously low it indicates nothing of remote usefullness in terms of weather. To me at least. Maybe someone with a masters in xenometeorology. That'd be what they'd call it right? kind of a niche career path there...
