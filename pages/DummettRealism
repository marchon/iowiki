*What is it?*

Dummett trying to give a general account of what is going on in the realism debate (as well as arguing for ..anti-realist positions with regard to a few different areas).

*Where can it be found?*

Dummett, M.; 'Realism' in Truth and Other Enigmas, pp. 145 - 165.

*How does it fit in?*

It's the fundamental source for Dummett's ..anti-realist position.

*Summary*

_The realism debate in general_
- there exists a disputed class of statements (D)
- debate is with regard to whether or not the statements in D have an objective ..truth-value
-- realist: elements of D have fixed ..truth-value
-- ..anti-realist: elements of D are neither T or F
--- denies law of the excluded middle
- can also be seen as a debate over the notion of meaning:
-- realist: meaning is what it is for a statement to be true
-- ..anti-realist: meaning is knowing what counts as evidence for a statement
--- hence the ..anti-realist can still give an account of how we know what statements in D mean
- the different attitudes towards ..truth-values in the debate lead to different conceptions regarding valid deductive inference
- note that Dummett does not believe that adopting the ..anti-realist position commits one to ..three-valued logic
-- possibly because statements in D just do not have a ..truth-value

_Evidence_
- a distinction needs to be made between direct and indirect evidence
-- but what does indirect evidence mean for the ..anti-realist?
-- something like: if <direct evidence> then X
--- can D statements be used in the antecedent?
---> yes => X a D statement
---> no => X and antecedent must be given in terms of R statements (see 'Reduction' below)
- so ..anti-realist is okay with ..truth-values being asserted in cases where there is evidence in principle (i.e. we have an indirect justificastion) but not when we are incapable of obtaining evidence
- context changes what is considered to be conclusive evidence
-- e.g. the acceptability of inductive reasoning as conclusive proof in science

_Reduction_
- ..anti-realist accounts are often reductive:
-- identify some reductive class of statements R
-- element of D is T only if some corresponding element of R is T
-- the reductive class is what provides evidence necessary for meaning on the ..anti-realist account
--- hence it is essential that statements in R can be understood independently of statements in D
- reductive account is neither necessary nor sufficient for ..anti-realism however

_Particular applications_
- covered pretty well in Garrett.Dummett so I'll just cover a few points of interest here
- only direct evidence available in the case of mathematics
- ..anti-realism as constructivism in mathematics
----
*What do I think?*
- the context-dependent stuff needs to be worked through a little more
-- exactly how does a context come about?  is it socially constructed?
--- if so, then realism (or at the very least the existence of ..truth-values) becomes a social construction too and many on both sides would be unhappy with this characteristion
--- how does Carnap fit in here?
- overall two stratgies for criticism:
--> 1. Descriptive inaccuracy (doesn't adequately capture the realism debate)
--> 2. Internal problems with Dummett's position
