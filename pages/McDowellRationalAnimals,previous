# ..McDowell's Views

In lecture six of Mind and World, (amongst other things) ..McDowell attempts to draw a distinction between rational animals (i.e. humans) and ..non-rational animals.  He does this by making use of Gadamer's distinction between living a life in "the world" (i.e. the fully conceptual, distanced experience we are familiar with as humans) and in "the environment" (in which one is purely responding to biological imperatives).

"Mere animals," as ..McDowell refers to them, do not have the conceptual capacities necessary to experience what it is like to live in "the world."  Furthermore, this does raise a problem for the obvious fact that animals are responsive to their environment as just evidence of response to biological imperatives.  Hence we do not need to credit animals with subjectivity, nor do we need to credit them with an experience of their environment that is in any way similar to our own.

# Discussion
*green The move from the observations that we do  not _need_ to credit animals with conceptual receptivity to the conclusion that we _should_ not credit them with such is one that seems to be glossed over in ..McDowell's treatment.  Perhaps it could be argued for along the lines of ontological parsimony (..McDowell talks briefly about the absurdity of including such complexity into any account of an animal way of living) but this is not even attempted.
