In regards to the Huw Price article in which he criticises Hawking for not giving a reason for how he arrived at the conclusion that our universe is low entropy approaching high entropy. Does anybody think that Hawking has an answer or do you think that slightly embarrassed that he has been challenged and not having an answer he is remaining silent?

Before I realised the date the article was published I thought Hawking was just being thorough in his answer to Price. Then I noticed the date, the Price article was published in 1989. So why would Hawking not answer the question in almost 20 years if he had the answer when he wrote his book?

I thought that seeing as Hawking wrote the book he would be happy to explain aspects of it. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe Hawking doesn't think we deserve the information if we can't work it out for ourselves.

Or maybe there is some conspiracy in which the secret is being kept from us...

*pink Hmmm Could be he decided not to dignify it with an answer...(rather arrogant, and not very productive)...If it is through embarrassment, this would go against a strength that Hawking showed when he admitted he believed something that he'd been working on and saying for ages was actually wrong - That showed alot of strength of character and integrity IMO
Maybe he'd been working on an answer and got stuck? If this was the case, what could he write in response? "umm dunno still thinking about it" :p

A conspiracy huh...Wouldn't be the first time scientific knowledge was hidden from the world by government - Nicola Tesla is a classic example (this guy was SERIOUSLY awesome!). Hawking silenced by US government...would make good world headline!
