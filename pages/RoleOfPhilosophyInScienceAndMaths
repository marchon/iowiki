*blue It helped Einstein.  Is that the sort of thing you mean?  Or something more general?  Jason*

*green I guess I was thinking a bit more generally in terms of how the practice of scientists and philosophers interacts (although Einstein is probably a good example for some sort of descriptive starting point).*  

*green In particular I have been trying to decide if the distinction (if any) between what mathematicians and scientists do had any bearing on the interaction (I guess any difference would have to hinge on the greater role of logical necessity in mathematics).*

*green Another consideration would be how these considerations would impact on quietist approaches to philosophy (such as those proposed by ..McDowell and Wittgenstein).  I guess I'm still not convinced that philosophy need necessarily "leave everything as it is."*

*blue Just on that last point: I've never had any time for quietism.  But there is a well-known tendency (noticed by Russell among others) for the most useful bits of philosophy to get stolen by other fields, notably science and maths, leaving it seeming as though philosophy (what's left of philosophy) has "left everything as it was".
