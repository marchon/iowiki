*red Yeah ... and if you're not sure I guess you can find someone who did the course last year and ask what books they used. And if they're not right, can return them and get the right ones.*

That's my experience too. Even if there is no text list, you can pretty much tell what books will be used for which courses, just by checking the shelves. Of course, you have to be in Canberra several weeks before semester begins, so students from out of town are at a disadvantage.

they release what textbooks you'll need heaps early anyway! in my four and a half years at university i have never had a problem with getting a textbook bc i go in and get mine a couple weeks before classes start - no queues, and about a million copies of the book you want!

Yes, you are paranoid. The Co-Op Bookshop is not entirely to blame. Often they don't get text lists from lecturers until fairly close to the beginning of term, and they can't order what they don't know about. Also, they don't always get accurate figures about student numbers, or how many copies to order. My sister used to work for the Co-Op, and I've heard many stories from their side of the fence.

Google has a copy of the entire book available on Google Books for you to read. There doesn't seem to be any easy way to print it off, so its probably not a replacement for the real thing, but it should help in the mean time.

Incidentally, if you are sick of hassling the co-op bookshop to get copies in, I found the book on a internet bookshop for about $52 with free delivery. I only ordered mine the other day so I haven't got it yet, but I have ordered from them before and they are pretty good.

Hope this helps.

Also, I've photocopied Chapter 1 but forgot to bring it to the tutorials.  I can give it to the couple of you who still haven't got books at Tuesday's lecture.
