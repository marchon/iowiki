The purpose of this discussion post was originally to explain why animal-based medical research belongs in the lowest category of the evidence hierarchy, but extends to a consideration of the ethics of using animals in medical research based on new biological insights. This follows on from an interesting discussion in the 5pm tute yesterday. 

For most of the 20th century, animal models of human diseases have been a valuable resource leading to many medical breakthroughs. The animal ethics committees of universities continue to grant ethical clearance to research groups using animals based on the perceived success of animal models of disease, and until recently, this success was very well supported by the apparent biological similarity of model organisms (e.g. mouse) and humans. 

However, the consensus is changing amongst biologists, especially immunologists, whose research relies almost exclusively on analysing animal tissue. Despite two decades of well-funded research, cures to major human diseases such as Type 1 diabetes have not been found. However, many methods have been found to prevent the onset of Type 1 diabetes in mouse models. Many drug or other intervention trials that are successful in mice lack efficacy in human trials. The following paper provides a summary of research into Type 1 diabetes and points out the flaws in relying exclusively on animal models, especially ‘golden standards’ such as the NOD (non-obese diabetic) mouse, which has been bred to display a very high incidence of Type 1 diabetes. The paper calls for improved correlation of data obtained from animal studies with human immunological data at more stages in the research process. 

Roep, B. O., M. Atkinson, et al. (2004). "Satisfaction (not) guaranteed: re-evaluating the use of animal models of type 1 diabetes." Nat Rev Immunol 4(12): 989-97.

Medical Advances Without Animals (MAWA) is an Australian trust established in 2000 that funds medical research using exclusively human-derived products. MAWA are not antivivisectionist; rather in a similar vein to Roep et al, MAWA envisions that the solution to human diseases will ultimately come from the replacement of animal experimentation with human-based research. An example is replacing commercial serum preparations (normally derived from cows) and antibodies (normally derived from rabbits) with human-derived products that have been donated to medical research (e.g. by giving blood). More importantly, it extends to replacing animal models of disease – e.g. research into the onset of vascular disease during diabetic pregnancy is currently being achieved by collection of white blood cells from pregnant diabetic women. The increasing availability of non-invasive techniques and advanced tissue culture make it easier to obtain, prepare and store human tissue samples, and more difficult to justify the use of animal samples. 

There are a few new fields in cellular biology that are fairly blurry at this stage but will have some interesting implications for the use of animal models in research. Basically anything with ‘omic’ as a suffix fits into this category. Most people are familiar with genomics, as the greatest success thus far has been the sequencing of the human genome. The genomes of a variety of model organisms are also available. Proteomics looks at the full set of proteins in the cells of an organism - usually just one cell type! Proteomics is much more complicated, as the proteome of any given cell will vary at different times and conditions, and unlike genomics, the very act of extracting the proteome is likely to cause considerable changes, such as the masking of some proteins, and the physical interaction of proteins that are normally separated in different organelles in the cell. However, proteomics will yield extremely useful interesting information about how the genome is used in an organism – for example, how many proteins does each gene produce, how are proteins modified during their development, and other fundamental questions. Metabolomics is really a stumble in the dark, as it attempts to characterise the entire set of metabolites (i.e., anything produced!) in a cell. Some biologists think metabolomics is a useless pursuit because the results are so highly constrained - all the considerations in proteomics apply even more so to metabolomics - which leads to doubt as to whether the results can be applied to biological systems. Once again, metabolomics could highlight further differences between humans and animal models, which would seriously challenge the assumption that model organisms adequately represent human diseases.

The ethics of animal experimentation is usually considered to be in the realm of philosophy. Biologists have appeared capable of justifying animal experiments in medical research on the basis of utilitarian arguments and historical success in treating human disease. As biotechnology becomes increasingly sophisticated, biologists must re-evaluate the role of animal models of disease both medically and ethically. The necessary paradigm shift will only come about by increasing funding for human-based research programmes. National funding bodies should take MAWA’s lead and explicitly support human-based research.

Response:


New treatments have to be tested. If they didn't have animals to try it on first ... they'd have to go straight to humans. It's impossible to plan for every single thing the new compound might do. It might change some biochemical pathway or other for the better, but what if it changes another, unexpected one and a whole trial of people have their eyeballs explode and their organs corrode from the inside out?

Making new organs from stem cells to test on would be great, except that it's unlawful and, even if it wasn't, would be hideously expensive. Plus, it wouldn't be testing on the entire biological system and wouldn't pick out most of the things the new compound would do.

Making things from human products would be great except that people usually aren't too generous with their bodies (some people aren't even organ donors for goodness' sake) so again, hideously expensive. No matter what technology we get, it isn't going to change people's selfish natures. And a few products won't change the need to test on an entire biological system either.

There are a few choices.

1. You can test on animals, then humans, and have no horrible excruciatingly slow, painful human deaths in trials. But there may be a some painful mouse deaths

2. You can have some horrible, excruciatingly slow, painful human deaths in trials

3. You can have no trials and have MILLIONS of horrible, excruciatingly slow, painful human deaths

4. You can have no medicines at all and have a global life expectancy of 30

So what's your choice? I would rather have no excruciating human deaths, thanks!! 

Erin Tewes

Hi Erin,

It seems that we are discussing different issues. To clarify, the research based on human products that I was referring to is at the basic level of research - well before the clinical trial stage. Currently, drug design and development research is conducted using animal-derived products, including antibodies, serum, proteins etc. Whilst success may be achieved at this stage of research and at the animal trials stage, drugs often have little or altered efficacy in human trials. 

Some immunologists are questioning the value of using animal products rather than human-derived products in fundamental research. Diabetes is a good example; despite two decades of well-funded research and a lot of success in animal models, injected insulin remains the only viable treatment option for diabetics. It is interesting that you describe stem-cell research as 'hideously expensive'; perhaps two decades of somewhat unproductive research into diabetes could also be classified as such! You would be surprised at how expensive it is to maintain a facility such as the Australian Phenomics Facility, with all the regulations associated with housing genetically modified and infectious animals. 
The distinction between animal and human models of disease is quite apparent when considering diabetes; a multitude of preventative methods have been discovered to prevent onset of Type 1 diabetes in mouse models, yet not a single treatment has proved effective in humans. There are some important differences in the clinical presentation of diabetes in mice and humans, which highlight the flaws in using animal models of disease.

Groups such as MAWA do not oppose the use of animals in drug trials; instead they encourage the development of new technologies based on human-derived products, particularly in the initial stages of research. The MAWA website has some interesting examples of medical research using human-derived products. Similar groups are also established internationally. 

I understand your point about people being selfish with their bodies. However, techniques in tissue culture are developing quickly. Many 'immortal' cancer cell lines from human cancerous tissues are currently available and groups of cells can be purchased. Cancer cells are easier to maintain than other cell types, but one of the anticipated outcomes of stem-cell research is the capacity to grow other cell types indefinitely. In effect, research centres would house, or have access to tissue banks derived from a small but sufficient number of original donations. 

For the foreseeable future, drug trials will need to commence with animal trials before progressing to the human phases. However, it is likely that drugs developed on human tissues will have more success in treating human diseases than drugs developed on animal tissues. The role of animal models of disease in the intial stage of research can therefore be called into question, in light of new biotechnologies and insights into human and animal biology.

*fawn The proportion of animals which are used in drug trials is very small (at least in Australia, and I suspect ..world-wide).  Almost all animals are used in more basic studies, of the sort Melanie's discussing.  That's in medical research.  Animals are also used in other sorts of research, of course, principally cosmetics research and weapons research.

By the way, in NSW all these research animals are all protected by the same laws, and I think that's true in the rest of Australia too.  In many other countries, animals in medical research are mostly not treated too badly (although there are some awful exceptions), but animals in cosmetics research and weapons research are not well protected.  And then there's the much larger number of animals in farms and factory farms, which have almost no legal protection in any country I've heard of; certainly not in Australia.  I'm getting off the topic, but I thought you might like to know about the legal situation.

*blue
I've never quite understood why animals get any ethical consideration in and of themselves. If animal tests are inefficient, don't do them. If killing animals compromises ecosystems in a way that kills/harms more humans than it helps, don't do them. But if you can efficiently breed millions of animal X and then kill millions of animal X (however horribly) all to save a single human life - I don't see a reason why it wouldn't be allowed. 


Greg.Sadler*

*green I'll come back to your utilitarian argument later, but for now - there is no guarantee that killing millions of animals will save a single human life. Many medical scientists maintain that it is ultimately more efficient (if initially more expensive) to use as many human-derived products as possible when conducting research into human diseases. Groups that fund this type of research are not anti-vivisectionist or pro-animal liberation, instead it is a serious acknowledgment of developments in biotechnology that can improve the way human medical research is conducted. 

On a slight tangent, there is some truth to your statement that we kill millions of animal X to save a single, or few human lives, in the sense that most medical research focuses on Western diseases, which kill comparatively few people to, say, diarrhoea or malnutrition. It would also be possible to save a lot of human lives by directing more medical research into preventative medicine, by considering the sociological/environmental causes of disease. It is much, much more efficient to prevent cardiac disease (which may be caused by poor diet, which may in turn be caused by inadequate public health education initiatives) than run extensive animal experiments and drug trials to treat cardiac disease. Obviously a combination of the two research programmes is necessary.

Melanie*

_But *if you can* efficiently breed millions of animal X and then kill millions of animal X (however horribly) all to save a single human life - I don't see a reason why it wouldn't be allowed. _

I'm not saying that, descriptively, we do kill millions of animals to save one human. Nor am I saying that we ought figure out some way to kill millions of animals to save one human. What I am saying is that, if hypothetically we encounter the situation where we have the option of killing millions of animals to save one human - we should take it.

I'm not advocating utilitarianism, merely saying that (as humans), we should only take into account the benefit and detriment to humans. Non-humans (animals, rocks, machines, environments etc) ought only be considered to the extent that they impact upon us.

examples:
- earth's environment is pretty damn important because we need it to live. 
- If people desire to sustainable and healthily farm/hunt [insert animal]-meat - go for it. Be in bluefin tuna, chickens, monkeys or whales...
- Mars' environement is pretty damn unimportant because it has no impact on our lives.


etc

*green I'm not convinced that we know what is to our benefit and to our detriment. You mention the environment; that is a recent development. The concept of sustainability has only recently attracted wide attention. Historically we did not consider sustainable environmental management to be of benefit to humans. 

There is still the important point that medical research based on human-derived products is likely to be more beneficial than animal-based research. It is not sufficient to discuss animal based research in terms of its benefits and detriments alone; a comparison is necessary. 

I'm not advocating an immediate abolition of animal-based medical research, instead I am advocating a shift in thinking about the role of animals as models of disease, and supporting medical innovations that depart from the entrenched doctrine that animals are necessary for medical research. 

A high percentage (up to 90%, depending who you read) of medical research does not directly use animals, though it may rely on animal-derived products such as blood serum. 

Malaria research is a good example of why a shift in thinking is necessary. Mouse models of malaria are in use, however there are many vital differences between human malaria and mouse models of malaria, including the causative agent and the major protein involved in drug resistance. This is not an oversimplification, and many scientists studying malaria acknowledge that mouse models of malaria aren't particularly relevant. However, the mouse models continue to be used, with less success than other methods, perhaps because the use of animals in medical research is so dominant that the glaring inconsistencies are glossed over.*  



*orange I have a couple of questions relating to Greg's statements:*

"But if you can efficiently breed millions of animal X and then kill millions of animal X (however horribly) all to save a single human life - I don't see a reason why it wouldn't be allowed."

*orange By "allowed" do you mean condoned in an ethical sense?*

&

"What I am saying is that, if hypothetically we encounter the situation where we have the option of killing millions of animals to save one human - we should take it.

I'm not advocating utilitarianism, merely saying that (as humans), we should only take into account the benefit and detriment to humans. Non-humans (animals, rocks, machines, environments etc) ought only be considered to the extent that they impact upon us."

*orange If not anthropocentric utilitarianism, what are you advocating in terms of an ethical framework, and how do non-human animals fit into it?

Why do humans have priveledged status?

Does this status apply to all humans?

Are there any other animals (than humans) that have elevated status?

What is a human?

Hamish*

*pink Yes, by allowed I mean not prevented by medical ethicist. 

I'm saying that animals don't count. I'm not asserting any ethical system for sorting all the stuff after you've decided animals don't count.

Humans are priveledged because it's humans who are making the system. I wouldn't expect dolphins or aliens to give me ethical consideration. I think a species ought to focus on the survival of the species.

All humans are due consideration,  no animals are. I don't want to comment on how you make the tough decisions where humans and humans are involved. That's a far bigger question.

No other animals are humans. Only humans are humans. Other animals all belong to their own different species

A human is a technical term relating to our species. If it's not our species, it's not a human. The details are for biologists to sort out.

(I should repeat my caveat that animals are due consideration to the extent that the animals are important to people.)*

Greg.Sadler

*green There are a lot of dangers in deriving ethical principles using the species concept. Definitions of species are fluid. Imagine if a new primate species was discovered living in a remote area of Africa, that was demonstrably more self aware, more adept at producing tools, more nurturing of their young, basic language skills, more visibly capable of emotion than chimpanzees, (which are capable of all of the above), but to a lesser extent than modern humans. What if diseases of this new species were directly and uniquely transferable to humans, and vice versa? What about the possibility of reproduction? Donkeys and horses are sufficiently close genetically to produce viable offspring (mules) but mules are sterile (due to an uneven number of chromosomes in each cell). The same situation could readily apply to an intermediate species between humans and chimpanzees (our closest known relative). The reproductive species definition is widely used (individuals capable of producing viable offspring belong to the same species). Viability may or may not include fertility in the offspring - there are different schools of thought on this one. Some biologists may consider the new 'animal' to be sufficiently human-like to redefine humans as a sub-species of a broader taxon, which includes the new species I have described. 

What ethical considerations would you grant this imaginary species? 

In my opinion, the species model lacks the stringency required for the derivation of strict ethical principles, because of the possibility of intermediate species, or equivalent species (whether ancestral, homologous or convergent) whose developments in technology, communication etc have been limited by the environment. The latter is a pattern seen in human populations all over the world.
As soon as you let go of the idea of humans as a uniquely and necessarily advanced species, other issues become very important - including the capacity for emotional response, the ability to feel pain and stress, the capacity for conscious thought, self-awareness, awareness of environment, and level of awareness of the distinction between members of the same population/species and 'outsider' individuals, including humans. 
Of course, to answer these questions scientifically, we are inclined to do research on animals! The manner in which this research is conducted then becomes extremely important, and should be as compassionate and minimally invasive as possible, regardless of what we currently know about animal cognition. 

Mel*

*orange Thanks to Mel for wading in here. This can be dense stuff and I was taking a long time to order my thoughts. The horse has bolted now, so I’ll try to keep up.

Mel mentioned* ‘As soon as you let go of the idea of humans as a uniquely and necessarily advanced species, other issues become very important’ 

*orange So my question to Greg is: Why are humans privileged in your view? 

Before answering consider this:(Descriptive) It is not all ‘humans’ (whatever that type-term represents) who are making the ethical system, but only a limited number of tokens of the type human. If the ethical system doesn’t only apply to those tokens (i.e. the ethicists/public policy makers – I don’t think Greg would want to suggest this), then we (normatively) need a very clear idea of what objects count as tokens of the type human. As Mel has already mentioned, there are issues relating to the application of species concepts. This gets to Greg’s point that:* ‘A human is a technical term relating to our species. If it's not our species, it's not a human. The details are for biologists to sort out.’ 

*orange (Descriptive) In my view the biologists haven’t sorted it out. Moreover I doubt they can sort it out to a degree that will satisfy philosophers. Biologists argue about (among other things) what criteria should be used to define species – reproductive, morphological, geographical, genetic, and many others including various combinations. Philosophers of biology argue about (among other things) whether it is possible to define species. 

Part of the reason for conjecture may come down to context. Biologists working within different paradigms (disciplinary matrices) seem to favour different species concepts, to the extent that species concepts are a good example of Kuhn’s meaning incommensurability (according to my reading of it). To biologists working according to a (there are different versions) phylogeneteic species concept, the term ‘species’ will mean something that is not translatable into the species concept according to a paradigm using a (again multiple versions) biological species concept. It doesn’t seem to me that any ultimate resolution can be achieved; I believe that we are attempting to create distinctions that aren’t physically realised, rather than describing distinctions that are real. 

Even if the controversy can be resolved, and an uncontroversial definition of species can be arrived at; I challenge the Universe to provide me with one that we can use now. It seems to me that there isn’t a satisfactory definition of species that will function for the ethical situation we find ourselves in (deciding what counts in terms of ethical research). If there is such a definition, clearly the people at NHMRC (Australian - National Health and Medical Research Council) either don’t have access to it, or don’t think it relevant (or I’m not reading enough of their documentation). I have looked at their statements: Australian code of practice for the care and use of animals for scientific purposes; National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research; Policy on the Care and Use of Non-Human Primates for Scientific Purposes (all available via the website http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/   just search for the document names within the website). I would think that it would be a high priority (for distinguishing between the intended targets of the guidelines) to define Human, to state what distinguishes a Human from a non-human primate, and to stipulate what (in terms of definition, if not justification) distinguishes a Human from a non-human vertebrate or a cephalopod (non-human vertebrate or cephalopod being the stipulation of what is an animal within ‘the code’). However, these things are not made clear by the aforementioned documentation. I think the reason is twofold: First I think that the policymakers may have realised just how controversial species concepts are and decided it was more pragmatic to allow people (policy interpreters) to assume what is meant by the undefined terms (I don’t like this – I’d prefer complicated and accurate than simple but vague…Ideally, I’d like to simplify the complications without sacrificing accuracy); Secondly because the policymakers had other priorities than clarifying terms for marginal cases (I don’t like this either because marginal cases tend to be what show us when our definitions are oversimplifications and because I consider the ethics of marginal cases to be something too important to dismiss).

My position is that a distinction which includes ‘all humans’ (depending how you define this), and excludes all other animals, is likely an arbitrary distinction, and far from the most suitable (let alone reasonable) basis for an ethical system.

A system, like the NHMRC guidelines, which has multiple levels: 
1) Human
2) non-human primate
3) non-primate vertebrate + cephalopods

Is closer to what I am thinking, but obviously (to me) grossly oversimplifies, and still gives humans a privileged position (seemingly without justification). I agree with Mel (if I understood her correctly) that, in deciding how to reduce the oversimplification of such models:*
‘Of course, to answer these questions scientifically, we are inclined to do research on animals!’

*orange What I don’t understand is that, in light of the problems of intersubjectivity (not being sure whether someone else can have the same sorts of experiences you can – e.g. pain, pleasure etc), we are generally quite happy to assume intersubjectivity between what we think of as humans, but not nearly so willing to extend that intersubjectivity beyond the ‘species boundary’, even if it doesn’t exist, or can’t yet be shown to exist.

To Greg, and/or anyone else who wants to venture an answer:
In terms of research ethics: What criteria are relevant to deciding what counts as human (i.e. on what basis should we determine what objects fall under NHMRC’s ‘National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research’)?

Or should we do away with species-based ethical distinctions and attempt to ground our ethical distinctions on something a little more substantial/uncontroversial? If yes, then what should we use as grounding?

Or some other issue that arises from this discussion.

Hamish*


*What ethical considerations would you grant this imaginary species?*

I think I’ve already provided the framework needed to answer the question. If the new species is sufficiently human that their work is worthwhile to us, and sufficiently social that they wouldn’t want to work for us if we experiment on – than it would be unwise to do it. Alternatively, if the new species provides a great human analogue for experiments by are not of economic use otherwise – experiment away!

*In my opinion, the species model lacks the stringency required for the derivation of strict ethical principles*

Stringency required for the derivation of strict ethical principles!? I can’t even being to fathom how philosophically non existent the derivation of ethics is. People seem to come up with ethical systems, and then just assert them.  There is no derivation, logic, consistency or rationality applied. 

*As soon as you let go of the idea of humans as a uniquely and necessarily advanced species*

I’m no saying that at all. I’m saying that humans are OUR species. The features are irrelevant. What matters is that they’re US. If a species of alien rocked up that was like us but superior in every way I think we shouldn’t kowtow to them (unless it’s economically wise). We are us and that is valuable in and of itself. Why is pain or emotion important? 

*What is a human*

I’d like to stress that I’m not a biologist, so I don’t want to overstep my mark. But it seems to me straightforward. I could point at someone, lets say Jason, and I think most people would agree that he’s a human. I think that I could point to a rabbit, and most people would agree that it’s not a human. We could find some more ‘boarderline’ cases. Perhaps we cut Jason’s arms and legs off, and then asked if his still a human. I don’t think many people would change their mind. Perhaps we find a smart tree-animal – but I think most people would agree it’s not a human. If an alien from mars arrived tomorrow – I think people would again agree it’s not a human.

*Summation*

I don't think my opinion ought be controversial. It's essentially just a blindly economic approach. If we profit from killing animals, do it. If we don't profit, don't do it. Profit is synonymous with benefit. To argue any alternative is to put the suffering of an animal ahead of the suffering of a human. I can't see how that could be justified.

-Greg.Sadler


*blue I've never quite understood why disabled people get any ethical consideration in and of themselves. If medical research on the disabled is economically unsound, don't do it. If killing the disabled compromises our environment in a way that kills or harms more able-bodied people than it helps, don't do it. But if you can efficiently breed and kill millions of people with disability X (however horribly) all to save a single able life - I don't see a reason why it wouldn't be allowed.

In all this, I'm merely saying that (as able people), we should only take into account the benefit and detriment to able people. People with a disability (whether it be Down syndrome, cerebral palsy or schizophrenia) ought to be considered only to the extent that they impact upon us. 

In response to some questions:*

*By ‘allowed’ do you mean condoned in an ethical sense?*

*blue Yes, by allowed I mean not prevented by medical ethicists.*

*What are you advocating in terms of an ethical framework, and how do people with disabilities fit into it?*

*blue All I'm saying is that disabled people don't count. I'm not asserting any ethical system for sorting everything else out after you've decided they don't count. *

*Why do non-disabled people have privileged status?*

*blue The able-bodied are privileged because it's we who are making the system. I think a group of people ought to focus on their own survival.*

*Does this status apply to all people without disabilities?*

*blue All able-bodied people are due consideration, no disabled people are. I don't want to comment on how you make the tough decisions where able vs. able is involved. That's a far bigger question.*

*What ethical considerations would you grant someone who has a mild disability?*

*blue I think I’ve already provided the framework needed to answer the question. If person is sufficiently able that their work is worthwhile to us and sufficiently social that they wouldn’t want to work for us if we experimented on them – then it would be unwise to do it. Alternatively, if the person provides a useful subject for experiments but is not of economic use otherwise – experiment away!*

*Remind me again why able people are so special.*

*blue I’m not asserting that there’s anything special about able people. All I’m saying is that WE belong to that group. The features are irrelevant. What matters is that they’re US. If a species of alien rocked up that were more able than us in every way I think we shouldn’t kowtow to them (unless it’s economically wise). We are us and that is valuable in and of itself. Why is pain or emotion important?*

*Summary*

*blue I don't think my opinion ought to be controversial. It's essentially just a blindly economic approach. If we profit from killing the disabled, do it. If we don't profit, don't do it. Profit is synonymous with benefit. To argue any alternative is to put the suffering of the disabled ahead of the suffering of able people. I can't see how that could be justified.

I hope people will see this post for what it is. It was not posted by a previous participant in this discussion.*

*orange I don't think you can draw a sharp distinction between able/disabled, even if there's a threshold above which no-one is disabled, surely you could distinguish between different levels of able, and do so across various characteristics/traits to produce a fairly chaotic (a better word???) outcome. That is to say you might put ability at a certain task, say making pragmatic economic decisions, on a cline, but then have a cline for every characteristic, and when you produce a matrix like that for people, how will you decide their relative importance?

Also, it isn't all tokens of the type 'human' (whatever that is) making the ethical system, its just a limited subset of tokens of the type human, so why, by your logic, should that system apply to you or I?

More later, off to our lecture,
Hamish*

Thanks for the post Blue. My only caveat to your compelling argument is that there is an economic value attached to human emotion. For instance, if you got kicks from killing Jason's Alpacas, and you told him that you'd like to buy them off him for $10 - he'll likely say no on account of the value his pets have for him both practically and emotionally being greater than $10. Alternatively, if you decided that the kicks you get from killing Alpacas is so great, that you'd happily hand over $10million for his pets - he might be more inclined to bargain with you.

*green There is a major problem with applying an economic argument here. If I were in Jason's position, I would probably readily admit that I can happily live without $10 million, but I can't live happily without my alpacas - hence the economic argument dies on emotional grounds, which shouldn't be readily rejected. Even if you want to go with the economic argument, there is still the question of how valuable the economic contribution of rich, unhappy (Alpaca-less) Jason would be, compared to your own contribution (based on the $10 million exchange). 
This can be extrapolated to animal ethics more generally, but I'm out of time as the tute starts in 10 minutes... maybe more on this later...*

Also, I think (based on my experience) that people with disabilities can be very strong economic contributors - just like able-bodied people. Although, some are not. I think I'm in favour of allowing judges to order that brain-dead bodies (like Terri Schiavo) ought to be taken off life-support. I think (hope) most people would agree with that.

As to your point about breeding, breeding disabled humans would be a hugely costly exercise. 

Greg.Sadler


*blue Thanks for the reply Greg. There are a few things I would like to add.

- I would be the first to admit that many people with disabilities are economically useful. However, as you said above, not all are. In fact, this group of non-contributors is _much_ larger than just those who are brain-dead.
- Animals (not just pets and such) do have an emotional "economic value", at least to some people. This is evidenced by the existence of this discussion in the first place and also by the money spent on medical ethicists.
- On the flip-side, not all disabled people have a large emotional "economic value" associated with them. In some societies, people with disabilities are held in very low regard and treated poorly. This can be especially true for those with no living relatives. Also, there have been times in history when people with disabilities have been accorded astonishingly little emotional value. The Holocaust was one of the more extreme cases. If you are prepared to accept this type of treatment as sound, then I respect your consistency but deplore your humanity. Otherwise, you need to explain what the difference is between discrimination against disabled people and discrimination against animals.
- In any case, stating that there is an "economic value to human emotion" begs the question. Why should we take into account all _human_ emotional values and none of those of other species? If the answer is "because those humans are economically important to us, in one way or another", then what happens if they are not? Why can't I do experiments on Rwandans (about whom I care very little, economically or otherwise) in order to test medicines or make-up for use by my family (about whom I care a lot)?
- I had originally planned the parody above with white/black instead of disabled/non-disabled as the example. Many of the arguments you have used above could be (in fact, have been) used to support practices such as black slavery. You might argue that slavery was "bad economic use" of black people, but this appeared not to be the case for the owners, many of whom became very rich from it.
- I agree that breeding disabled people would be very expensive and I probably should have removed this part from my original post, as it has little to do with your argument.
I guess that, to me, the main problem with your argument is that it can be used to support the exploitation by any connected, powerful group of any weaker outsider group.*

*green ignore me i think we were posting simultaneously i got really confused. in conclusion, i like yr argument bluey!*

*pink Blue has made a very good argument. A combination of slippery-slope and reductio ad absurdum has opened my position up to fairly destructive ad hominem attack.

me: animals aren't worth moral consideration
blue: animals are like disabled people
therefore you don't think disabled are worth moral consideration
therefore you're like hitler*

-*blue Yeah sorry about that, I probably shouldn't have. Although, I think the point I was making was clear enough. For the record, I wasn't saying that Greg is like Hitler, merely that his argument can be used to justify some things I wouldn't touch with a ten-foot pole. Generally speaking, I don't think that properly-formulated appeals to strong emotions are inappropriate in a discussion of ethics. However, as in this case, they are often more distracting than useful. Blue.*

*pink The usual play when stuck in an ad-hominem corner is to fight fire with fire. _"You're arguing that disabled people are no better than animals. You're abhorent!"_ But that's cheating, like the hitler-analogy, and I reject both as bad argument.

That leaves me with the slippery slope and the reductio ad absurdum. I have two options, (1) I argue my way out of the slippery slope by rejecting the analogy between animals and humans, or (2) I argue that the ostensibly absurd position I've been put in is not as absurd as one might think.

I sort of conceded option (1) in my previous post. I accepted the analogy between animals and humans in some select cases. It might not be wise to go back on that. But I should stress that we're not really talking about a slippery slope here, more of a slightly dripping tap. That's to say, you've accepted most elements of my position but for the anomaly of the particularly useful animal and the particularly useless person. This is VERY rare. If my system works for almost all cases, we can simply call it the exception that proves the rule.  I recognise your exception as remarkable and use it to show the general truth of my approach. If we were to cast my approach into a rule or a law, we could just fudge this tiny error and move on with our lives.

The danger with (2) is that I come across as a nut bag. Fortunately I care very little of what people think of me - so I'll give that a bash as well.

I have debate's like this very often with some friends of mine, and a hypothetical often comes up which we've called "Hush's Hermit". The idea being that some religious hermit decides to permanently shut himself away from society. He welds himself inside an impregnable box and buries himself deep underground. He can never communicate with the outside world and he can never leave the box.

I believe, that for all purposes, the hermit is now dead. He can never engage in society again - just like a dead person. Hell, if you think about the cat in the box, he could well BE dead. Imagine he's buried himself on a very valuable seam of gold, that we need to blow-up to access. Do we give moral consideration to the Hermit? I'd say not.

Hush's Hermit is different from Blue's African because Blue's African is member of a global economy - and the offspring of Blue's Africans will be members of a global economy. If I lived in the stone age and had to compete with other humans for resources, would I kill them? Sure.

On the point of slavery, there may have been a time when slavery was economically wise. But post-industrialisations it's not. My theory is both normative and descriptive on that issue.

Now, I've got two more moves up my sleeve. (3) I damn the alternatives. Any other system of morals or ethics is WAY more problematic than mine. If you can beat me - I'll join you. (4) I shift the goal posts.

(4) I've essentially welded two arguments together - one for each of my world views. If blue is in my tute, blue may recall that I view the world in two ways - perceptively and predictively. I have two world views, one which revolves around me as the subject that makes the world exist - in which you're all objects (Perceptively - that's how the world appears to me). The second in which I posit that you're all subjects like me - I do that to aide in predicting what you're going to do (here I'm essentially a scientific realist). 

The species-centric view has spawned from my perceptive understanding of the world, slightly altered to make it palatable to you. That's to say, it's not the species I care about here, it's only myself. That might lead to certain outcomes for objects in my universe - but I really can't care. 

The economic-centric view has spawned from my predictive understanding of the world. That's to say, the arbitrarily more complicated world view in which I pretend you're subjects for the purposes of making accurate predictions.

Has one of those 4 plays saved my hide?

Conclusion:
Extending the animal-similarity slippery slope to black people, jews etc obviously isn't viable. My argument can't be adapted to oppress the minority group of your choice.

Regarding disabled people - it's a very high degree of disability that makes someone socially useless. Look at Stephen Hawkings - that guy kicks arse. If you imagine someone who is a quasi-vegetable, it'll take the full time effort of multiple people to keep them alive. Suggesting that we withdraw treatment from them and instead use those resources to save many hundreds of people from dieing of preventable causes is simply NOT an absurd or disgusting position to hold. 

Thanks for your time*

*orange I generally approve of the new developments in this debate. But there are still a few things I wish to clarify, if you will indulge me:*

*pink The species-centric view has spawned from my perceptive understanding of the world, slightly altered to make it palatable to you. That's to say, it's not the species I care about here, it's only myself. That might lead to certain outcomes for objects in my universe - but I really can't care.*

*orange In my view this makes your argument much more reasonable – it no longer runs into an issue of an arbitrary or at least ‘intuitively obvious’ (as far as I understand) distinction between human/non-human or able/disabled, it simply focuses on you – much less arbitrary, especially from the metaphysical discussions I’ve read between you and Lorenzo.

However I wonder what you mean by the concluding remark:* *pink ‘Extending the animal-similarity slippery slope to black people, jews etc obviously isn't viable. My argument can't be adapted to oppress the minority group of your choice.’*

*orange As far as I can tell your position allows (viably) you to take any entity other than yourself with a grain of salt (in terms of ethical value) and only consider how valuable any entity (regardless of type) is based on economic benefit to you. This means (in my reading) that you could ‘oppress’ anyone, not based on membership of a minority but just in any case where you consider the oppression to be economically advantageous to you. So your position would allow you (if I’m understanding said position) to exploit, for example, Jewish people, not because of membership of some religious/ethnic/cultural/racial/whatever minority, but because the exploitation stands to benefit you economically. I’m not intending suggestions of abhorrence or disgust with regard to your position; I’m just clarifying whether I view it as absurd.

It seems to me that blue’s concluding statement still holds:* *blue ‘the main problem with your argument is that it can be used to support the exploitation by any connected, powerful group of any weaker outsider group.’*

*orange In any case where the weaker outsider group was considered detrimental to your economic success, and you had the power to exploit or remove them – that would be allowed. 

Now, if you mean this position to be for use by you, in determining how to move through this ocean of chaos; then I don’t find your position absurd. But my interpretation is that we’re discussing what basis a society should use for determining what levels of ethical consideration should apply to what objects (in the context of a research ethics framework). It seem to me that, in this context, your position wouldn’t hold because we’re looking for a system that can be shared by a society (applied generally) and your position has to take an individual as its focal point (is this action going to benefit me – or the things I care about). In order to extend such a position to a society, you would then be faced with the question which I have continued to stress, which is: How do you decide what things qualify for participation in society (i.e. considered valid members of the focal point for the ethical position)? I can understand how, by your position, one person could decide this for themselves. I can’t understand how, by your position, some consensus, or near consensus could obtain in a society in which there are many individuals with different priorities.

I like the ‘Hush’s Hermit’ problem. I wonder though, is it being shut away from society that is relevant or being shut away from any part of society that is relevant to you (as the person making the decision)? If there were an island, with 100 inhabitants, which was truly and permanently isolated from the rest of society (think scientology and the force-field trapping Intergalactic Lord Xenu – just for fun); would it matter whether they died? Say there’s a busy shipping route that would be more efficient if the whole island was removed. Would it be ethically problematic by your view? I guess I’m asking: is it social interaction which is essential to ethical consideration, or whether it is social interaction that could possibly influence you that is relevant? Or something else?

Please point out any of my assumptions that have missed the mark. I like this debate, I’m just trying to clarify that we’re debating the same issue/s.

- Sorry, for the concluding remark I welded my ideas back together. The idea that the slippery-slope doesn’t extend to minorities in general is simply because, evidently, most minority groups are important economic contributors. Obviously people’s skin colour, eye colour or whatever has nothing (or very little) to do with their ability to contribute to the collective. (Religion is different. I think that absurd faith cam make people non or negative economic contributors. It seems to me that the Catholics, with their stance of contraception and GM food, are pretty much bent on causing genocide in Africa. Which is economically bad. But this is a whole other issue quite a long way removed from Philosophy of Science).

- So, if we’re talking about society in general, I’m sort of happy for you to ignore the ego-centric elements of my arguments. They’re not all that relevant. Take the pure-economic approach. Something like Adam Smith.

- Yes, it’s social/economic interaction with the relevant society (i.e the society which this discussion is part of the social sphere of). So the scientologists in the force-field will be justifiable pissed off if you blow them up (within their society). And the cost of blowing them up is relevant (for you). But the fact that you’re killing them is of no ethical consequence (for you).

- I appreciate you sort of dealing with my dualistic world view. I know it’s awkward and unusual, but I think everyone ought to adopt it because it solves *so* many philosophical problems. For example, the other minds problem: are other people conscious like me? Perceptively no; Predictively yes. It’s really becomes a very straight forward question. Does the outside world exist? Perceptively it exists only as phenomena; predictively the entire universe exists as best understood by science. As a scientist, you need only worry about the predictive world view, and you can stash the perceptive one at the back of your mind. If it ever so happens that some dirty French philosopher says _‘you know, ze world you look at thru ze microscope, it does not actually exist!’_ you can dredge out the perceptive world view – agree with the dirty French philosopher – and then get on with whatever you were doing.

*orange A clarification not really to the point: I only meant to take the permanent, impenetrable force-field trapping the Intergalactic Lord Xenu from Scientology - not to make the hypothetical people on the island Scientologists.

*orange I'm interested in a tangent here Greg. I wonder what your position would be regarding a hypothetical person who was in their early-twenties, had never worked and thus never contributed tax, studied at university accruing a debt to the government and sustained themself on a government allowance. If this person is unassociated with you then I suppose it is of little interest to your position, so let's say they are competing with you for some economically valuable resource: Tutorial participation marks. This person seems of little value, is there any justification for continuing to support them?
