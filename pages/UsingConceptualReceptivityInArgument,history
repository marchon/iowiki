- Another aspect of the use of this ..subject-first viewpoint is whether one is justified in moving from argumental uses that are purely reliant on its decriptive accuracy to those uses which are reliant on normative implications being made from this viewpoint.  In particular, an investigation of Heidegger's justification in moving from the descriptive accuracy of "throwness", etc. to the normative implications of "authenticity", etc. would likely be illuminating.

*The Idea*

The position that the subject, who is direct receipt of concepts from perceptual experience, is primary and must be taken as our starting point for philosophy seems to be incredibly powerful when dealing with standard philosophical positions and disputes (consider for example the way the problem of the unity of consciousness evaporates when one takes the subject's conceptual experience as inarguable).  

Given this power, it seems that it would be a good idea to develop a clear idea of when the ..subject-first strategy can and can't be employed.  A first step in this investigation must be to argue for the ..subject-first view (which I believe can be done by arguing that one cannot recover self-consciousness from any other starting point).  Next, one would need to give an abstract account of exactly which argument strategies it is possible to make use of the ..subject-first viewpoint within.  Finally, one would need to assess the validity of these uses.
