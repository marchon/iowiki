I was reading in New Scientist the other day about deterministic relativity.  Apparently in the first half of the 1900's both de Broglie and Bohm proposed that nature is not random as quantum theory explains - it just seems that way.  I only got to reading half of the article at work, but noticed a mention of the de Broglie - Bohm interpretation of quantum mechanics and Bohmian mechanics and how these offer a different interpretation of quantum theory that allows for determinism.  I was wondering if anyone has some information on this, as I am most interested (and have misplaced my copy of New Scientist!!) in all repurcussions of this - if it turns out to be true.

Yes.  There's more about this in Poetry-FurtherReading, under “Einstein and the Quantum Spooks”.  Jason

*green quick link to overview of relativistic determinism - don't know how correct it is...seeing as it is on the internet it must be true! :P*
