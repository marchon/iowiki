For this course, you'll need a copy of:

Scott Soames, _Philosophical Analysis in the 20th Century, Volume I: The Dawn of Analysis_ Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2003

This is available from the ..Co-Op bookshop for $43.16 (members' price).

I'll add more ideas for further readings to this page as I think of them.  And you can add to this page yourself: choose "Edit Page".

# primary material
The following should have been in the course reader:
- KnowledgeByAcquaintanceAndKnowledgeByDescription (Bertrand Russell, 1912)
- OnDenoting (Bertrand Russell, 1905)
- TwoDogmasOfEmpiricism (W.V.O.Quine, 1951)
- EmpiricismSemanticsAndOntology (Rudolf Carnap, 1956)

# books
The following are some of my favourite books.  There are squillions more books on this period, so if you don't like these or can't get them, ask me for more recommendations or look on the web or in the library.

J. Alberto Coffa, _The Semantic Tradition from Kant to Carnap: To The Vienna Station_  Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1991

Peter Hylton, _Russell, Idealism and the Emergence of Analytic Philosophy_ Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1990

John Passmore, _A Hundred Years of Philosophy_ London: Duckworth, 1957

Simon Blackburn, _Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy_ Oxford: Oxford University Press, any edition ... not particularly relevant to this course, but useful for any course on Western philosophy

One I haven't looked at yet but which I'm reliably informed is very good is:

Graham Stevins, _The Russellian Origins of Analytical Philosophy: Bertrand Russell and the Unity of the Proposition_, Routledge, 2005

#web sites
Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org) is good for brief biographies of the people we'll be studying.

The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (http://setis.library.usyd.edu.au/stanford/contents.html) is a very good online encyclopedia of philosophy.  Unfortunately, the categories it uses don't line up particularly well with the categories we need for this course.  (E.g., there's no separate entry on ``semantics''.)  But you might find bits of it useful anyway.

You can find a number of interviews by prominent analytic philosophers (including Ayer, Quine, Putnam, Searle etc) here (http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=flame0430).
