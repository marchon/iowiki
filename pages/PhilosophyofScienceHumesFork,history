In Class Jason said ‘Hume would have had a 4 pronged fork’. As a part-time Cutlery historian I can tell you that the dominant British fork had only two tines up until around the times of the Napoleonic wars where three-tined forks become more popular. Four tines are a relatively modern invention.

Just in case you care...
