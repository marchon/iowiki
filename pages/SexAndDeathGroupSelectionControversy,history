Let’s first recap on the basic concepts again:  that way we can argue over whether the basic concepts are right, and not at cross-purposes.

*Altruism*, in a biological context, is any trait or action that benefits the recipient to the detriment of the altruist.

*Group selection* is the idea that organisms may act altruistically, for the good of the group.  

*Kin selection* is the idea that altruism is explained by the benefit rendered to genes shared between the altruist and the recipient, and is therefore an aspect of gene selection.

*Trait groups* are populations where every member feels the effect of other members with respect to some trait (eg. Alarm calling in vervet monkey troops, on spotting predatory hawks).

Note that there have been two different conceptions of group selection.  These have excellent explanations in the Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy (which is online), so I won’t discuss them here, except to mention that it is the second type of group selection, championed by DS Wilson and E Sober, that I want to discuss.  

DS Wilson argues that selective forces can favour trait groups and hence group selection, even if the members of the group are unrelated.  Now Wilson states that several things need to occur for trait groups to exist:

-(1) You need a series of intrademic (isolated populations the breed amongst themselves) populations, where most of the members in altruistic trait groups are altruistic to start with, and most of the members in selfish trait groups are selfish to start with.

-(2) After the selfish groups have gone extinct through being rude and inconsiderate, the separate demes (populations) must recombine, and wind up in groups where condition (1) is once again met, before the next round of selection.

-(3) Trait groups must be regarded as part of the environment in which selection occurs

Simpson’s paradox is mentioned in Ch . 8 of Sex and Death as an explanation of how this might work.

Now if everything in this scenario did work exactly as described here, then yes, I think that some groups would do better than others, and due to this process of group recombination (seems very similar to homologous recombination between chromosomes, doesn’t it?) the proportion of altruistic individuals will increase over time.

However, I think these conditions are highly unlikely to be met over the long, continuous stretches of generational time that are required for natural selection to have a cumulative effect, enabling evolution to occur.  Consider a some population that periodically breaks apart, then recombines on the basis of how altruistic your fellow group members are.  I don’t think a pattern as complex as this could persist without accidents spoiling the assortment of required for condition (1) to be met.  If, by chance (or perhaps some form of non-random group assortment) homogeneity of altruistic members for a trait group has been achieved, all it would take is one selfish interloper and the whole process would have to start again.  It still seems very susceptible to the cheating that Darwin himself first said was a problem for evolution.

Even if these conditions could be met, I still wouldn’t think that this is an instance of group selection.   The organisms behaving altruistically must have at least the allele that pre-disposes them towards altruism in common.  For altruism to persist, the frequency of this allele must increase to fixation, or at least stabilise over time, and therefore be competitive overall.  Perhaps the altruistic allele is an example of an outlaw gene, propagating itself at the expense of other selfish alleles within a population?  In any case, if you have an allele in common, and your altruism is favouring that allele, then that is the definition of gene selection by kin selection.

I would argue that kin selection or reciprocal altruism (which isn’t true altruism, but delayed action selfishness) are the best explanations for all instances of biological altruism.
