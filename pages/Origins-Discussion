If anyone feels like discussing anything about the course, you can use this page, anonymously or nonymously.  If you post something clever, and give your name, you will get tutorial marks.

You can and should make sub-pages of this page. To do that, type in the word "Origins" followed by a dot followed by whatever you want the sub-page to be called — eg., Origins.I.fancy.Queensland.in.the.rugby.this.year. When you save your edit, the phrase will automatically be turned into a link to the new sub-page.
