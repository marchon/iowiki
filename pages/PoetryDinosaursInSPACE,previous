The concept of a possible dinosaur civilization, which we touched on in discussion today:

Excellent!  Thanks.

Although the main article is terrific, the comments seem pretty missable to me, except for two: (1) ``I, for one, salute our Dino overlords'' (maybe you had to be there) and (2) a link to this comic from the Perry Bible Fellowship:

Talking of which, here are some of my other favourite comics from the Perry Bible Fellowship, most of which have nothing to do with the course ... but starting with one which is VERY relevant:

*red Do we dig up the posessionless cave hippies of the late cretacious in the Bad Lands or would there surely be one or two hard bodied objects nearby, say a shattered lense or fossilised wooden framwework, which would stand the test of time on some level comparable to their biological fossilised remains? Looking at the Antikythera device, we tend to jump pretty ferociously on any kind of technology out of place.


Am I just being a fun crushing bastard here? To answer my own question, my favourite PBF comics are "spankings" and "bee"

Since we're in the business of posting giant pics about dinosaur civilizations, I also recommend this one:

*blue Is that an actual photo?  Jason*

Of course not. Humans and dinosaurs never existed side by side.

JeffAlstott

*blue Of course you're right.  In actual wars they were always on opposing sides :--)

Jason*

*green So thats what happened to the dinosaurs! Caught in the middle of a war between humans and little green aliens! - cool.

It looks more like the herbivores fighting the carnivores to me, just with lasers.

*blue But the herbivores have different coloured lasers from the carnivores.  What's with that?

Jason*

*red Hahaha. It actually makes sense if you think about it. Considering that troops are required to wear appropriate garb to label themselves as friend, foe, or civillian, coloured lasers would logically follow, and as well all know, dinosaurs are the most logical animals that ever lived.

*purple The carnivores power their lasers with a pink pigment derived from cochineal beetles (food additive number 120 for those who want to make cool pink lasers) - this pigment was a no-go for the herbivores who had to settle for a plant-based blue 'laser-powering-pigment'
..T-Rex was a herbivore...right?

*red Its ok. The Pteradon wasn’t actually a dinosaur at all and so, despite its herbivorosity (totally a word), it could plausibly defect. Check out http://www.creationmuseum.org/ if you need any more information on dinosaurs. That is, if you really need a comprehensive and reliable source. I think I have a photo from one of their exhibits at home, but I’m typing this at work (because I’m naughty) so you will have to wait with bated breath...

Considering the difficulty in creating blue lasers (they only became commercially available in the last year or so and are prohibitively expensive) we could conclude that carnivorous dinosaurs were of superior intellect or at least achieved greater scientific advancement. I'm not sure whether the colour would play a part in the millitary applications but I'd be comfortable in concluding that this factor would be a good indications that it was the carnivores (and flying cowards) who won the war. Unless of course, the war depicted was in fact a civil war between herbivores, and the T-Rex joined in in alliance with the pteradons.. Oh my. The plot thickens.

*black The interesting thing to note about the awesome picture above (it's from the _Dino Riders_ TV series, if anyone didn't recognise it) is that the carnivorous dinosaurs (and the pterodactyls) needed the evil, tyrannical Rulons to place mind control devices on their heads to make them attack, while the herbivorous dinosaurs attacked happily without force.  It's nice that Tyco was teaching kids the message early on that it's always fine for the good guys to use any and all weaponry at its disposal.

While we're on the subject of television programs and inaccurate uses of the term 'dinosaur', was I the only one who realised that three of the five original 'Dinozords' from _The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers_ were not actually dinosaurs - Pterodactyl?  Sabre-toothed Tiger?  Mastodon?  I know it's a technicality, and they never explicitly state that these 'zords' are supposed to be based on the prehistoric creatures they resemble, but it still irritated me, a young teenager at the time who had wanted to be a palaeontologist since he was four.

I just wanted to put this here, because it's totally relevant.
