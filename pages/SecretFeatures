*SECRET THINGS YOU CAN DO THAT AREN'T MENTIONED ON THE INSTRUCTIONS PAGE*

*Page Templates*

You can edit the page template for your wiki using a URL like
http://localhost:8080/PageTemplate?action=edit&password=blithnock.  Replace ``localhost'' with your server's address if necessary, and replace ``blithnock'' with the template password you set in ..config.io when you followed the installation instructions above (if you did).

If you like, you can have separate page templates for separate projects in a single wiki.  To do this, give each page in the project a prefix (the same prefix) ending in a hyphen (``-'').  Then you can edit the page template for that project by editing the page <prefix->PageTemplate.  You can edit the page template for the project Wombat, for example, at
http://localhost:8080/Wombat-PageTemplate?action=edit&password=blithnock (with replacements as in the previous paragraph).  Then the page http://localhost:8080/Wombat-cuddling (for example) will use that page template.  But see walled.gardens for cautionary notes about separate projects.

All the page templates on a site share the same password.  If you need to use two or more passwords, run two or more copies of ..IoWiki with different port numbers.

You can display a page with an arbitrary template: http://localhost:8080/AdministratorDocumentation?template=ReadMe, http://localhost:8080/AdministratorDocumentation?template=Wombat etc. This is useful for saving pages in a format suitable for (e.g.) printing or saving as static HTML.

*Apparently ..Read-Only Pages*

See http://tumble.tk/ReadMe-apparently.read.only.

*Restoring Spammed Pages*

A URL like http://localhost:8080/PageName?action=restore will restore a page to how it was before the last edit.  (This restoration itself counts as an edit, so if you do it twice in a row you get back the page you had before you did it the first time.)  Soon I hope to add a ``Pestore Page'' option to the standard page template.

*Spam Blocking*

[This section is under construction.]

If a page is being repeatedly spammed, you can lock it by adding its name to the file {LockedPages.txt} on the server.  Subsequently it can't be edited until it's unlocked (by --- you guessed it --- removing its name from that file).

I could implement more sophisticated spam-blocking mechanisms, and I've experimented with a few, but this is my favourite at the moment, for reasons which I hope to document later.  In particular, it's deliberate that users can't lock or password-protect their own pages.  The point is to encourage collaboration.

*Secret Markup*

Nothing very exciting here, but {code [[[version]]]} is replaced by the name of the version of IoWiki you're running.  And there is secret markup to let you write [[[(]]] and [[[)]]] --- edit this page to see what it is.
