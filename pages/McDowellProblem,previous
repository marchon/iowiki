*green It's probably a good idea to get clear on exactly what problem ..McDowell is seeking to address.  Again, this is a quick and dirty starting point.*

In Mind and World ..McDowell is primarily concerned with the nature of our intentional mental states (those mental states directed towards the world).  In particular he wants to demonstrate how we can give a philosophical account of these states that doesn't leave us either spinning in frictionless void (i.e. where the way the world is doesn't have any impact on our intentional states) or remove freedom from our intentionality by positing that we are "forced" into our intentional states by the way the world is.  In a slogan: we want freedom with friction.

* Is intentionality the right way to phrase this problem?  Is ..McDowell actually concerned with some subset of these states?  If so, what defines this subset?
