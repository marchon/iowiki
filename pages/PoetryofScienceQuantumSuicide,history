Lessons from this cartoon:
- It makes a good reason to favour time-symmetric interpretations of quantum mechanics, which don't support the immortality argument (prima facie at least).
->I tried to suggest this in question time after David Lewis's 2001 Jack Smart Lecture, but David Lewis was self-chairing (warning: will make you go blind) and wouldn't take my question even when there were no other questions!
