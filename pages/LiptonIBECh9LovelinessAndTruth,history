[[[break]]]changed line 6 from: *orange {code --> 1. Hungerford's: loveliness is too subjective
--- ~: reliable inference is also subjective (cf Kuhn)
--- ~: loveliness criteria do not increase subjectivity (as a lot of them are also inferential criteria)
}*[[[break]]]to: *green {code -> 1. Hungerford's: loveliness is too subjective
-- ~: reliable inference is also subjective (cf Kuhn)
-- ~: loveliness criteria do not increase subjectivity (as a lot of them are also inferential criteria)
-> 2. Voltaire's: why should loveliness and likeliness coincide?
-- Given the problems raised by Hume, only positions that claim less use of induction than IBE can possibly be deemed better. 
-- e.g. Van Fraassen's constructive empiricism: acceptance of a theory involving unobservables really only involves belief that observable consequences are true.
