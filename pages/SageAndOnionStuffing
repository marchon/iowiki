6 slices of wholemeal bread

half a cup / 85g / 3oz of vegan margarine

4 teaspoons of dried sage or 8 of fresh, chopped sage

1 finely chopped large onion

salt to taste

Melt the margarine in a saucepan and then cook the onion in it until soft. Break up the wholemeal bread with your hands (into fairly small pieces) and then mix into the onion and margarine with the sage and salt. This can be pressed into an oven-proof bowl for baking.
