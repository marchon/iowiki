2005

# Friday 18 November
Adam, Jason
discussed: mathematical statistics, EBM verse basic science (and versus e.g. case control studies), group sequential trials, readings, applications of philosophy (as in philosophy of biology), applied Bayesian statistics, randomisation, cable guy, pharmacogenetics versus Yusef
next Wednesday: Jason and Adam to go through Berger and Berry together

# Wednesday 23rd November
Adam, Jason
Discussed: Berry and Berry paper: frequentist v conditionalists is key. Power and Vioxx example (argument for misleading magnitude via normal bayesian updating).  Mark's argument against p-values - problem with frequentist: "just not what we want" - still question of what replaces it.
Next Thursday...

(Figured it might be helpful in the long run to go broad with these meeting records)
# Monday 28 November
Combined meeting of UQ School of Population Health and Pharmacy (lead by  Wayne Hall and Sue Tett)
Discussed: Interesting stuff...  It is worth keeping in mind the general question which this group is interested in and how it may relate to where my project could head... The overall question here (and pretty much where I guess this groups interests intersect the most) is that of whether drug treatment does indeed lead to the intended population outcomes.  Framed in terms of my project the question is whether the way we currently conduct and draw inferences from large drug trials is sound (i.e. concurs with reality sufficiently to have the expected beneficial effects on the population).  An alternative framing of a question which is somewhat related and is worth keeping in mind is the following: Given that it is so difficult in to find appropriate evidence of population outcomes (i.e. EBM is completely ill-equiped for the task) how might this be done in the most rigourous manner possible.
Tasks: Chase Wayne Hall's review of methodologies for showing population outcomes. Chase NPS 'operational report'.

# Thursday 1 December
Adam, Jason
Discussed everything.

"A methodological rule for reporting the results of an experiment is good x% of the time."
Bayesian interpretation: ?
Frequentist intrepretation (pretty much by definition of "Frequentist"): on x% of hypothetical experiments, the rule will get the right answer x% of the time.
To do: look at Whitehead vs. Freedman and Spiegelhalter.

# Thursday 8 December
Adam, Jason
Discussed:
* objectivity of Frequentism vs. Bayesianism
* a possible research project: how to make Bayesian methods less subject to investigator abuse by fixing parameters, analogously to the way that Frequentists fix test statistics, cutoff level (5%) and, to a lesser degree, the model (Normal or whatever)
* combining Bayesian and Frequentist methods, as discussed by Berry and as done by QLD people
* maybe we don't want trials to be as efficient as possible (in terms of main effect), because that makes them less good at finding side-effects and generating new hypotheses; Jason suggests that instead of making this an issue of Bayesian vs. non-Bayesian analysis we should take into account the variety of possible Bayesian analyses.  Maybe instead of using Berry/Berger/Grossman trial monitoring methods in which we try to minimise the sameple size required to come to a conclusion about a single endpoint we should be having larger trials which take into account the importance of other endpoints and other types of hypotheses.  However, this runs up against the standard ethical argument that one should only continue a trial as long as one has EquqiPoise.

# Friday 16 December
Adam, Jason
Discussed: Jason to read Goodman paper.
Power v prior distribution. Differences - lying, political, minimal clinical significant differences.  Don't have to rely on power - argue based soley on prior of alternative hypothesis.  Might not need to go into how health fraternity as *acted*.  Differentiate between test-statistic and raw data/result - watch for result ambiguity. Berger has work on justifying the move from significant p-value to likelihood of alternative hypothesis.
Next meeting: probably Monday while Jason in Brisbane - to discuss Goodman papers... rofexocib

# Monday 19 December
Adam, Jason
Discussed:
factoring study design into Bayesian analysis
Goodman's theory of converting P-values to minimum Bayes factors

2006

# Thursday 5th Jan
Adam, Jason
Discussed: Interpretation of Goodman (pt 2).  Yusuf, Collins, Peto paper on large simple RCT
Tasks: More precision regarding how interpreting Goodman on wiki; Send Yusuf paper to JG

# Wednesday 8th Feb
Adam, Jason
Discussed: Peto - stuff; rofecoxib paper and presentation; jeffrey and exchangeability; bayesian trial design (adam's problem) - need take design into account for both prior and bayes factor.

# Wednesday 13th Feb
Adam, Jason
Discussed: PowerPoint slides on rofecoxib --- looking good; existence of paper on combining phase II/phase III trials in a Frequentist way (Royston, Parmar, Qian) Statistics in Medicine 2003;22:2239-2256

# Tuesday 21 Feb
Adam, Jason
Agenda: Jeffrey paper; statistical meaning of ``bias''
Discussed: Jeffrey review paper --- probably don't bother discussing Dorling in just a few words; instead give a few examples showing that this is only a good book for research, not for teaching; definition of ``bias'' is confusing; need to talk later about WHY people are confused about the meaning and (separately) the importance of bias
To do: Jason to finish commenting on the wiki page on Peto et al; Adam to play with the definition of bias

# Tuesday 28 Feb
Adam, Jason
Agenda: bias; overall project planning
Discussed: public health talk was a raging success; Jeffrey review almost done; bias
To do: refresh project proposal using stuff on wiki; write a paper on rofocoxib; think about WiP  seminar; write down some thoughts on bias while you can still see the duck

# Tuesday 14 March
Adam, Jason
Agenda: overall project planning; links between philosophy of probability and philosophy of science
Discussed: as above; new project outline is great
To do: look at Bas van Fraassen's papers on his web site etc.; read Berger and Sellke

# Wednesday 22 March
Adam, Jason
Agenda: look at jeffrey rv and start of rofecoxib; discuss project plan 
Discussed: new experimentalism; metaphysical underpinning of the distinction between classical and bayesian stats.
Remember Jason's diagram separating statistical methods - AL and JG differing separation but similar divide; continue exploring the divide along beleif in fact-of-the-matter so use error statistics + new experimentalism and the variety of evidence relating to many (infinite) hypotheses of bayesianism.  Consider how new experimentalism and bayesianism may fit together.

# Wednesday 12 April 
Adam, Jason 
Discussed: rofecoxib WIP seminar; current state of rofecoxib draft 
To do: keep going

Adam, Jason
Discussed: rofecoxib
To do: go back to meeting every week!

# Wednesday 17 May
Adam, Jason
Discussed: likelihood principle, Mayo's argument regarding Armitage and whether the bayesian has a problem with sampling to foregone conclusions; and precisely when this is a problem for the bayesian, AAP abstract submission
To do: talk this friday about general issues; follow up on Mayo/Armitage argument, send abstract ( Inferences.from.medical.trials.should.be.probabilistic 
 )

# Thursday 1 June
Adam, Jason
Discussed: Rofecoxib paper
To do: deadline for draft moved to 15 June

# Wednesday 7 June
Adam, Jason
Discussed: Rofecoxib talk preparation (going very well)
To do: give Rofecoxib talk; finish Rofecoxib draft paper

# Wednesday 21 June
Adam, Jason
Discussed: Rofecoxib draft paper, AAP talk --- don't add too much material for AAP, as philosophers expect you to go slowly
	To do: Jason to comment on draft paper; Adam to continue drafting and also work on AAP talk

# Wednesday 12 July
Adam, Jason
Discussed: congrats on AAP talk; Rofecoxib draft paper
To do: Adam to continue drafting

# Thursday 13 July
Adam, Jason
Discussed: Rofecoxib draft paper
To do: Adam to continue drafting

# Tuesday 18 July
Rofecoxib draft paper coming along better, thanks to decision to more or less leave Mayo out of it; will probably do a separate Mayo paper subsequently.  Sydney has offered a scholarship; just paperwork remains to be done.
To do: Adam continue drafting

# Friday 27 July
Invited to an important international conference.  Well done!
Paper progressing.  Current conclusion: classical statistics can't back up the inferences made in practice, even when they're sensible.  It (therefore?) can't play the role it claims to play in EBM.
To do: Think about p-value functions.

# Thursday 7 September
Worrall has commented on Rofecoxib paper.
To do: Jason to comment too!

# Tuesday 21 November
Update on where various projects are up to.  Currently completing presentation for Brussels; send for comment once done.  On return finalise rofecoxib paper draft. Next project ..---EBM, what must it be if it is going to make sense (and what it is almost definitely not)

# Monday 11 December
Economics/ethics paper presented in Europe: well done!  Possible follow-ups from that: (a) think about future work with economists; (b) email Andrew Thingy.
To do for the evidence workshop in January: think about presenting on (a) what EBM ought to be and/or (b) stuff about sub-studies case-control studies.  Probably (a), but put in stuff you already know backwards if you're having trouble thinking of enough to say about (a).
To do otherwise: submit short rofecoxib paper.

# Wednesday 20 December
Short rofecoxib paper submitted.  Long rofecoxib paper new draft due soon.
To do: finish next draft of rofecoxib paper.

# Tuesday 23 January
Discussed written comments on long rofecoxib paper, which is now looking excellent.
Discussed whether there's really an epistemic asymmetry between population information and individual patient information.
To do:
- Finish off long rofecoxib paper.
- Start drafting joint .Grossman-LaCazeEBMPaper.
- Go back over this page and collect other tasks.

Some stuff seems to have been lost from here.  Bugger.  In the meantime, rofecoxib paper submitted --- hooray.

# Monday 12 March
Started coursework at Sydney Uni.  Written a few thousand words on EBM from a ..pro-EBM point of view.
Discussed subjective probability.
