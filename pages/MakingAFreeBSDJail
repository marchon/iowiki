In FreeBSD 7, the instructions which are currently given all over the place, including in the current version of the FreeBSD handbook, don't work because {code mount_devfs} doesn't exist any more.  You have to replace {code mount_devfs} with {code mount -t devfs}.  It says this in {code man jail}, but it's easy to miss.
----
Jail environment sshd

To start sshd in the jail environment, add the following line to /etc/rc.conf:
{code
    sshd_enable="YES" 
}
----
Running the jail with its daemons:

{code ifconfig vr0 inet alias 209.146.250.44/32
mount -t procfs proc /usr/jails/alpha/proc
jail /usr/jails/alpha alpha.xeny.net 209.146.250.44 /bin/sh /etc/rc
}

... but you don't need this with ezjail ... except maybe the first line.
----
To make a new jail with ezjail (once you've done all the initial config, which I have):

{code ezjail-admin create -f xeny fully-qualified-hostname dns-address}

(the ``-f xeny'' bit is to use my local flavour)

then run it: 

{code /usr/local/etc/rc.d/ezjail.sh start}

start a shell in it:

{code jls}
{code jexec <jail number> sh} or {code jexec <jail number> bash} or {code jexec <jail number> fish}

_and change the root password_
----
If you need ports in the a new jail (which you probably do):

{code cd /usr/local/

fetch ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/ports/ports.tar.gz

tar xfz ports.tar.gz

rm ports.tar.gz 
}
