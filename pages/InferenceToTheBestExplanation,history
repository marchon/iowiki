*Another Issue*
Problem when using IBE with regard to theories involving inobservables: can formulate infinite theories involving inobservables - how can one ever verify that the IBE-based theory choice is the correct one?
Seems then that one must restrict IBE usage to non-theoretical contexts.

*Response*
-> P1) In the past science has demonstrated convergence in theories.
-> P2) IBE has played a large role in science in the past.
-> C) IBE leads to the truth
-> _Counter-args:_
-- Above argument uses IBE and hence is circular.
-- IBE might not have been the property of sci. practice in the past that led to convergence.  Indeed, it may have a deleterious effect but has just been cancelled out by some other aspect of the practice in the past.
