*Summary*
- is going to question how significant the gap between supposedly a priori philosophy and a posteriori natural science is
-- methodological difference is not that deep (cf. mathematics)
- will also deal with how we react to a priori nature of philosophy
- rough distinction between rationalism and empiricism on basis of whether a priori is seen as virtue or vice
-- move from crude empiricism to naturalism sometimes just involves adding naturalism to a priori commitments
--- *green should track exactly how this is supposed to work when it ..re-emerges*
- should we scale down the ambitions of philosophy?
-- just analyse conceptual/linguistic apparatus brought to bear in a posteriori investigations

*What do I think?*
- will be interesting to see how he goes on to characterise naturalism (if he does) and what impact different characterisations may have on his arguments
