[[[break]]]added at line 0: *lime {code A Random Interesting Conundrum......


P1:  If a modus tollens argument has true premises, then it is sound. 
P2:  The argument is unsound 
C:   Therefore, its premises are false.

(The above argument is not my own, but was taken from some internet site ages ago when I was looking up random stuff.  Unfortunately I can’t remember which site, but I suspect that it was from Wikipedia.)

What is going on here?

Modus Tollens arguments are deductively valid.  So for the argument above to be sound, then the premises must be true.

P2 is true, if the argument is unsound.  But for the argument to be unsound then (since it is presumably valid), one of the premises must be false.

P1 is true (seemingly).

P2 cannot be false since, for it to be false the argument must be sound.  But the argument cannot be sound whilst P2 is false.  
Hence it is logically impossible for P2 to be false.  
So, P2 must be true.

If the premises are true and the argument is deductively valid, then the truth of the conclusion should be guaranteed.  But C is seemingly false.

How intriguing!
Does anyone have any thoughts?  
Is this just a version of the liar or does it involve additional issues? 

Cool - My first edit!

Ps. How do you do colors?
