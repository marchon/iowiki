Bradshaw (1998) has proposed that an application of the Precautionary Principle tells us that we should accord a high moral status to many non-human animals.  His argument runs as follows.  ``A vast number of animals depend on us for their survival and ..welfare.''  (Bradshaw 1998 p.1)

We propose to greatly clarify this argument.  In particular, it is impossible to apply Bradshaw's argument to ALL animals (including for example plankton).  According to some versions of Bradshaw's theory it would be desirable to do so, but according to other more common-sense versions of his theory we can apply the Precautionary Principle to some concrete yet vague group of higher animals.  Perhaps counterintuitively, the notion of a vague group can be made precise [CITE WIDELY].  We propose to develop just such a precise version of Bradshaw's theory, in a number of variants, and to see whether any of the variants stand up to stringent criticism.

``There is a story about someone who came up to a well-known moral philosopher in a restaurant and asked him what he thought about the arguments for vegetarianism. "I've actually thought quite a bit about some of those arguments, and I'm half-convinced by them", he replied. "So I don't eat meat for lunch."'' (from Lipton quotes)
