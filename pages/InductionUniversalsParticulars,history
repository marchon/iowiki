}*[[[break]]]added at line 43: *lime {code Upon further consideration, it seems that we are in the following situation:
- Any descriptive account of induction needs to explain how we move from talk of particular events to talk of general similarities between those events.
- If such an explanation requires an ontological commitment, then further difficulties arise regarding how we move from the semantic to the ontological (see my note on modified Carnap below).
- If however, such an explanation only requires a semantic commitment, all one need do is provide an account of how such commitments are arrived at.

*Further Work Needed*

- The idea that trope theory implies that one can move from ontological to linguistic similarity concerns might be a little controversial - some further explication of how this happens is probably necessary.
- The one possible method of escaping the infinite regress argument against the existence of universals is to argue that no new universal is introduced as one moves up the chain of similarities beyond those of the ..first-order (i.e. one would argue that we don't need different similarity relations for universals themselves).  The efficacy of this response will need to be assessed.
- The difficulty of giving a clear account of how tropes are bundled will need to be addressed.
