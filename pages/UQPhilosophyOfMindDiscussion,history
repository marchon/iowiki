What are then the consistent alternatives? I'd say that if one insists in maintaining that his system is complete, then one cannot talk about metaphysics, and should in particular disregard any talk about minds. But then our minds and other people's minds would be on equal footing: none would have any better claim to existence. Another alternative is that, if one still believes one is meaningfully talking about metaphysics, one must believe that Wittgenstein system cannot be complete. But if assumed incomplete, his system loses its very essence, and it would be metamorphosed beyond recognition.

*Wittgenstein and solipsism*

This is apparently not being read much, but I'd like to give my 2 cents on the last lecture about Wittgenstein.

Suppose we agree with Wittgenstein and want to use a language which only refers to our perceptions. Then it follows that we cannot, in the language, talk about metaphysics, and particularly we cannot say that solipsism is true (or false) in any sense.

Truly, we cannot talk about other people's minds, because they are not in our perceptions. But our minds are not in our perceptions either. The perceptions, in and of themselves, make no reference to a mind that is having them. We do not see an homunculus inside. Surely we can perceive our bodies and maybe notice that they have a privileged position in our perceptual universe, compared to other bodies. But we cannot perceive our minds. We cannot point to a given perception and say: "that's what I mean by my mind", in much the same way that we cannot similarly point to other people's minds in our perceptions.

If we decide to look at our behaviours to associate them with our minds, then we could as well do the same with other people´s minds, and the whole argument for solipsism fails from the start. If anything, the mind is not any kind of external behaviour. 

And it's not just the set of our perceptions either. No matter how many perceptions you bunch together, that´s just what you get: a bunch of perceptions. And conceding that the mind was just the set of perceptions, then we could happily talk about it even in Wittgenstein's theory, since these are just the sort of things we *can* talk about. So the problem would be trivially solved by defining it away.

So we want to focus on the concept of mind that Wittgenstein had in mind (no pun intended) when he says (something like) "the facts of solipsism are quite correct, but that cannot be said". How can he reach that conclusion? Not by any reasoning within the language he agreed to use, otherwise it *could* be said. But then if he believes that this sentence is any more true and justified than stating the complete opposite "solipsism is quite false", or saying anything whatsoever such as "it's quite true that the moon is made of green cheese, but that cannot be said"; and if he believes that it is any more meaningful than just playing with your lips and making a stupid sound; then he must believe that his system is incomplete, i.e., that there are meaningful and true statements that can be said (and even seen to be true!) outside of his system.

But if his system is incomplete, that is, if there are in fact true propositions that cannot be stated in his system, than it does not follow that "the world is my world" or "that which can be said can be said clearly, and whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must keep silent". In fact, that would need to be changed to "whereof one cannot speak in the system, thereof one might still be able to meaningfully talk about, by stepping outside the system". His system, if incomplete, cannot justifiably lead one to solipsism, since this conclusion was reached exactly by assuming that the system was complete and by equating all the meaningful propositions with the propositions that can be stated within his system.

In conclusion, I argue that if Wittgenstein's system justifiably leads one to solipsism, it is incomplete. And further, that if it is incomplete, it cannot justifiably lead one to solipsism. Therefore the only consistent alternative is that  Wittgenstein's arguments cannot justifiably and consistently lead one to solipsism. It follows that the feeling that some have that his system leads to solipsism are an illusion, and I'd speculate that it is brought about by switching between different modes of thought during the argumentation.

I don't see how Tristan's comment is related to Berkeley's Idealism, but I might have misunderstood one or both. For Berkeley, is it the case, as Tristan said, that an idea is "only true in relation to another idea"? I thought that for Berkeley ideas are fundamental ontological entities, and are not relational. They exist by themselves, independently of other ideas. So there is no need for any chain of ideas.

Yeah you're right - I was taking the kantian view against the predicate 'existence' in ontological arguments and having a snipe at the reductio. Probably conflated Lebniz's suffcient reason and Berkley's idealism in doing so.

*Gruesome words*

Following up on the discussion in the tutorial on April 4th, I'd like to try to put down a tentative argument for why green/blue is a better  categorisation than grue/bleen.

First we need to agree on some common ground. I don't want to enter into a discussion about Semantics (even because I couldn't), but I will assume a position which could be defined as verificationist or operationalist. That is, I want to stick to cases where the meaning of words can be said to be related to procedures to determine whether a given object counts as a member of the extension of the word. There may or may not be words whose meanings are not operational, but I don't want to consider them now. (Actually, after saying that, I'd be happy to hear of grue-type problems with words whose meanings cannot be operationally defined) 

So, in this framework, the meaning of 'green' and 'blue' are related to an equivalence class of procedures which an observer considers that provide good evidence to determine if a given object is 'green' or 'blue'. One of these procedures is direct perception. The observer says
that an object is green just in case he has a particular perception when looking at the light scattered from the object. Another procedure in
this equivalence class could be a light detector which measures the wavelength of light that impinges upon it. Then an observer would say
that the object is green just in case the wavelength as measured by this detector is between 492-577 nm and would say that it is blue iff it is
between 455-492nm. There is an element of subjectivity in these procedures, of course, but that is hardly an objection against using the operational meanings. Meanings are subjective, that 's just how the world is.

Now we define the gruesome words. An object is grue iff it is green before 2008 and blue  thereafter and it is bleen iff it is blue before 2008 and green thereafter. (I found in the web other definitions of grue that do not imply that the object changes colour, but refer to the point of first observation. But let's stick to that one, because it's the one that we were talking about in the tutorial).

So the problem was: which pair of categories is more "natural", if any? Surely there is one which we use and one which we don't, but is there any good reason for that?

At first I thought it had something to do with our best physical theories, and how they say that objects don't change color arbitrarily. But on a second thought, that's just false. We can easily have grue objects according to that definition. We can just paint them in 1/01/08; it could have some
chemical reaction programmed to occur at that date; it could be a computer screen with a program to display a green ball before 2008 and a
blue one afterwards; and so forth. So to say that grue objects do not exist according to our physical theories is a terrible objection.

But after more thought I came to think that the reason that we don't use them, and the reason why green/blue is a more natural basis (I am not claiming that they are "natural kinds" - I don't believe that either - only that they are more natural than grue/bleen) is that they are the ones whose meanings are directly associated to the procedures as specified above. To determine whether an object is green/blue I can use one of those procedures. To determine whether it is grue
I need to use the 'green' procedure before 2008 and the 'blue' procedure - which is quite distinct! - after 2008.

Now I will try to address the argument that we can define green/blue in terms of grue/bleen. Even though from a logical perspective we can do that and it will turn out that all truth values remain correct, we still lack a procedure to determine whether an object is grue which is not parasitic on the procedures to determine whether it is green/blue. In other words, to find whether an object is green at a particular time I don't need to learn whether it is grue or not, but to find whether it is grue I do need to know whether it was green before 2008 and whether it was blue afterwards.

Jason said something about measuring  "blavelength", but I'm not sure how it would work without being just a translation of everything, in which case it would be trivially better to use grue/bleen. Unless he meant that to measure blavelength is to determine whether the wavelength is in the range 577-492 nm before 2008 and whether it is between 492-455 nm after 2008. But then by the definition of green/blue, this is the same
as determining whether it is green/blue before/after 2008. The converse is not true: to determine whether an object is green at a particular time there is no need to determine whether it is or not grue.

I have seen people talk about a hypothetical society that could evolve to use the gruesome words, but I can't see how that could happen either, since to correctly use the words they would need to understand that after a specified time their perceptions of grue/bleen would be
interchanged, and it is hard to believe that a culture could get to such arbitrariness. Or even if they could, the argument remains that they are
just doing unnecessary and unproductive extra mental work to talk about the objects of their experience.

In summary, I guess I would say that it is more natural to use categories which are more directly related to our observational apparatuses, without the use of unnecessary complications, if they don't play any role in our understanding of the objects/concepts in question.

Any comments?

I guess if we begin with the premiss that there is only ideas the result is a weird sort of ontology (and epistemology)which depends on some ultimate idea (perhaps like Lebneiz's monad?) - for berkely I guess this ultimate idea from which all other ideas eminated or were dependent was God. The question in my mind is what sort of proof would we need under Berkley's ontology for the ultimate idea (God)? My feeling is (and this is the great weakness of idealism) that actually we could get by with a pretty soft proof for the ultimate idea under Berkley's ontology and subsequent epistemology. After all if ideas are only true in relation to another idea then all we have to do is show that ideas form a chain with the only possible conclusion that their is an ultimate idea and then call it God. So the proof for God is easily attained under Berkley's ontology and epistemology - reductio ad absurdum. No need to worry about God's existence or not.

The only link I can think of is that we all have a brain, and our brains all look more or less the same and more or less unlike anything else, or anything else's brain.
