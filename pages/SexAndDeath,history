}*[[[break]]]to: *green {code Anything else I should put here?
}*[[[break]]]changed line 15 from: *orange {code *Good news:* only some parts of the textbook will be compulsory reading, and there won't be a lot of additional reading.  In return for being given very little to read, you’re expected to read each week’s readings on time, and to spend some time thinking about everything you read.

If you do the reading on time, two good things will happen:
- you'll enjoy the classes;
- other people will enjoy your contributions to the classes.

If you do the fortnightly assignments on time, two other good things will happen:
- you'll have a good chance of passing the course;
- you'll be happy during the examination period when you realise that a lot of your work for this course is already completed.

# Classes
Mondays 12--1
Wednesdays 1--2
Thursdays 12--1
... except that there are no classes on Thursday February 22nd (week 1), Monday March 19th (public holiday), April 6th-20th (mid-semester break), Wednesday April 25th (public holiday).

All classes are in ..A.D.Hope room 144.  Please ignore the old online timetable which says that some classes are in other buildings.

The Thursday classes are tutorials.  There will also be online discussion at http://xeny.net/SexAndDeath-Discussion.  (How much online discussion there is is up to you.)

There's a schedule of lecture and tutorial topics at SexAndDeath.Topics.  Most of the topics correspond to a section of the course textbook wich you should read prior to the session.

Attendance at all classes is compulsory.  If you have to miss a few classes, it's your responsibility to catch up, and if you have to miss a lot of classes you won't be able to catch up.

# Assessment
- Five short exercises set in the Thursday classes in weeks 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10, to be submitted by noon on Monday in weeks 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11, with answers between 200 and 350 words long: each worth 10% of the total mark for the course (total 50%)
- One essay of around 1500 and not more than 2000 words (due date to be discussed in the first lecture): 40%
- Class participation: 10%

The above word counts are strict.  Anything over the word limits won't be marked.

All assignments should be submitted via the chute outside the School of Humanities office in the ..A.D.Hope Building.  You'll need to complete a cover sheet --- located in the wooden box outside the office --- and staple it to your assignment, prior to putting it in the chute.

Anything submitted late will be severely penalised, unless (i) you have a major, unavoidable and _well documented_ excuse such as a severe illness documented by a medical certificate or a religious holiday which covers the whole period of assessment, or (ii) you have joined the course after the period of assessment.  ((ii) is unlikely to apply to anything except the first short exercise.  (i) is unlikely to apply at all.)

All work submitted for assessment must be your own.  Plagiarism will receive heavy penalties and may mean you fail the course.  You're bound by the university and Arts Faculty policies at http://info.anu.edu.au/policies/Codes_Of_Practice/Students/Other/Academic_Honesty.asp and http://arts.anu.edu.au/student_information/current/rules/plagiarism.asp.  These policies may be obvious if you've already written a lot of humanities essays, but if you've mostly done science subjects then they may not be.  Plenty of good students fail humanities courses by plagiarising, so take this issue seriously.

You can use any referencing style you like (see examples at http://ilp.anu.edu.au/citations) as long as it's consistent.  It's fine to use stuff from the Web as long as it's good stuff (just as it's fine to use stuff from the books as long as it's good stuff), but beware that not all lecturers are enlightened enough to follow this policy yet.   To cite something from the Web, give both the address and the date that you consulted it (because, unlike books, Web pages can change at any time).

# Various other stuff
If you're new to humanities courses, you should look at the School of Humanities Study Guide, at http://arts.anu.edu.au/humanities/hum_docs/studyguide.htm.

Information about philosophy at ANU, including a link to seminars etc., is available at http://arts.anu.edu.au/humanities/philosophy/index.htm.

The lecturer can tell you more about other philosophy courses and other philosophy activities going on at the ANU.

# Fun
This course should be fun.  If it's not then probably either the lecturer is doing something wrong or you're having a general problem with university.  Either way, the lecturer might be able to help and you should consider talking to him.   If you have a problem which you don't want to discuss with the lecturer, there are a number of other people you can talk to; a good person to start with is probably the Convenor of the Philosophy Discipline, Jeremy Shearmur <Jeremy.Shearmur@anu.edu.au>.
