# handbook description
This course aims to provide a conceptual understanding of some of the many faces of the large-scale universe.

We will discuss general issues relating to the nature of mathematics and science, space and time, and the universe as a whole.

The main topics of the course are: the overall structure of the observable universe; space and time; relativity; black holes; phenomena and reality; anthropic principles; and extraterrestrial life.  Each topic will be introduced in a historical context emphasising how it has evolved over time and is still evolving.
