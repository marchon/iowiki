I have hardly any of my published work in computer-readable format.  I'm hoping to scan more of it when I get around to it.  For the moment there's only this:

- My Master's thesis, ``Unified hypothesis testing, point estimation and interval estimation for group sequential trials'' (University of Sydney, 1993): http://xeny.net/files/statistics/Grossman-group-sequential-trials.pdf (~10 MB)
