# Abstract

Murphy's Law states that what can go wrong will go wrong [Murphy posthum. 1893].  We prove this law from a set of very plausible premises.  First we sketch the proof, and then we provide a rigorous proof; finally, we discuss how the premises might be varied to take into account a number of prominent positions in metaphysics and ethics.

# 1. A sketch of the proof

Let *w* represent a thing which can go wrong.

Let *V* be an arbitrary infinite-dimensional vector space.  Let ||*V*|| be the natural norm (inner product) on *V*.
