This relates to my last post. My poor sweet little friend science has become sick and weak from the things that nasty man Khun has been saying about it. So I am putting this post hear to try to help reassure any of the other scientific realists in the class that are feeling a bit upset about the state of what was once the proud soaring edifice of science: the highest good of which the human mind was capable. It's a link to the final chapter of a book by Bertrand Russell called "The problems of philosophy"

Just to remind myself that the true value of philosophy can only really be experienced when those who are philosophising can embrace the uncertain, and venture into the realms of 'liberating doubt': 

Freedom from dogmatism is more important than certainty in science i spose. Are there any other scientific realists out there? What do you guys reckon about Khun et al? Are we ever going to be able to formulate any definitive objections to his ideas?

Here is one of my favourite parts from Russell's essay: 

*red "Thus, to sum up our discussion of the value of philosophy; Philosophy is to be studied, not for the sake of any definite answers to its questions since no definite answers can, as a rule, be known to be true, but rather for the sake of the questions themselves; because these questions enlarge our conception of what is possible, enrich our intellectual imagination and diminish the dogmatic assurance which closes the mind against speculation; but above all because, through the greatness of the universe which philosophy contemplates, the mind also is rendered great, and becomes capable of that union with the universe which constitutes its highest good."*
