Hi...

My name is Sammy, which is short for Samantha...
I can be contacted on my email address, which is:
u4306700@anu.edu.au

I am in the third (and final) year of my BSc (Psychology) degree, and this is my first Philosophy course.

Wow, I can sum myself up in 6 lines...

Umm... _desperately searches for something to make self sound interesting..._

I also like to read novels
And play Netball
And pool

And...

I got a goldfish when I was in year 2 that I named Mrs Burston, after my year 2 teacher. That same goldfish lived for *8 years!!*
