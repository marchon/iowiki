*What is it?*

RSSS are running a reading group on Williamson's The Philosophy of Philosophy.  I'm going to write a 5,000 word paper on it.

*Where can it be found?*

Williamson,T. (2008); The Philosophy of Philosophy; Blackwell
----
*Paper Topic*

No Ifs, Ands or Nots - Boghossian and Williamson on epistemic analyticity and a priori knowledge

- they clash on the analyticity front over the link between understanding on meaning
- they clash on the a priori knowledge front over Boghossian's "blind reasoning" argument for a kind of brute entitlement on the basis of understanding logical concepts
