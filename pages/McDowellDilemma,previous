*green I'm just going to hammer out a rough depiction here.  Maybe people can respond/edit to flesh things out in terms of what's missing, misconstrued, insufficiently detailed, just plain wrong, etc?*

For ..McDowell, when we consider the relation of mind and world, in the context in which it has been approached in the past, we are drawn into an eternal oscillation between the Myth of the Given (which doesn't allow for freedom of spontaneity (*green At least when it comes to intentional mental states?*) and offers exculpations for our intentional mental content instead of something normative) and Davidsonian coherentism (which leaves us "spinning in a frictionless void" out of contact with the world).

At this stage is probably a good idea to develop clear accounts of the two positions we are oscillating between:

Myth.of.the.Given

Davidsonian.Coherentism
