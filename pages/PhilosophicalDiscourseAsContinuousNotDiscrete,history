*Just a rough idea*

The idea here is to look at instences where philosophers have tried to make a discrete break between cases and when this does and doesn't work.  The idea arose from thinking about some of the views of Quine and Carnap, in particular Quine's denial of the (discrete) analytic/synthetic distinction and Carnap's linguistic frameworks (formulated by Carnap as discrete but a more accurate picture might be of a continous flow between and overlapping of frameworks).  It seems that there is a general philosophical move one can make by highlighting where a false discrete distinction has been made and replacing the ditinction with a continuum.  It would be interesting to look at the conditions under which this sort of move was and was not feasible.
