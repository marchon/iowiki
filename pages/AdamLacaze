It's after work. It's late at night at Binna Burra Mountain Lodge 2200 feet above sea level on a cold Australian winter night. While squirrelling through Google, checking where I ranked in the long list of Lacaze's - here I found Adam's wiki......and I learnt something!

That's funny, because at the same time I'm in Burra.  Different Burra, in NSW, but also about 2200 feet above sea level.
