*Where can it be found?*

Maddy, P.; Indispensability and practice; The Journal of Philosophy, Vol. 84, No. 6; pp. 275 - 289

*How does it fit in?*

Gives arguments from descriptive inaccuracy against confirmational holism.  The descriptive inaccuracies are sourced from both scientific and mathematical practice.  However, the interpretation of naturalism that Maddy uses to give the descriptive argument normative bite is a little questionable.
