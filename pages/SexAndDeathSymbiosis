In the lecture on 15 Mar 07 I said Dogs and people, aren't truly symbiotic (which, strictly speaking, is right), they are commensal (which, strictly speaking, is wrong). Mea Culpa.

The correct definitions for the types of relationships species can have with each other (accoring to ecologists) are:

Commensalism - living together, but only one species derives a benefit.  Eg. Clownfish and Anemones (can be regarded as mutualism if you believe the anemones get a benefit too).  *blue [This means you can get course credit for watching Finding Nemo.  Jason]*

Mutualism - an interaction between two species where both derive benefits. Eg. Dogs and Humans, biofilms formed by microbes.

Symbiosis – this is actually has a couple of meanings.  Any form of living together can sometimes casually be called ‘symbiotic’.  *True symbiosis*, however, requires both species to require the other to live.  Eg.  There is a sea-slug that has photosynthetic bacteria growing in its back, and the slug uses the sugar the bacteria produce.  The slug requires this sugar to live, and the bacteria can only grow on the slug.
