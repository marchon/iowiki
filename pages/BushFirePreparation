- Every morning in the summer, check the NSWBushFireWarningWebSite.
- Rake up all the tiny twigs and leaves near the house in the direction of the prevailing wind.
- Mow the lawns around the house and drive *while they're green* lest we start a fire while making a spark in brown grass.
- buy ear and eye protectors for use with the whipper snipper - During the summer, let the Bells know if we go away.
- Make a kit of protective clothing, torch etc. --- see http://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au (http://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/dsp_content.cfm?CAT_ID=515?).
- How to start the diesel pump which keeps the fire tank topped up:
-- rectangular cap in the ground; near the pump: open and turn both switches;
-- round cap in the ground nearer the house: open and switch on;
-- on the pump itself: turn on the key; put the flow on between ``start'' and ``run''; check that water's coming out of the top; pull starter cord;
-- switch off the pump *before* it runs out of fuel, or you'll damage it.
