_``Every program attempts to expand until it can read mail.''_ --- Jamie Zawinski

I'm planning to add the following features to future releases:

- site index
- site search
- RSS change notification

I'm thinking about also implementing live-editable tables.

I'm not planning any other features.  ..IoWiki is going to remain simple, dammit.  If you really need something more complicated, I recommend CloudWiki or PmWiki.
