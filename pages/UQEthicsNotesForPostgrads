If you're a postgrad (e.g., if you're enrolled in PHIL7130) then get some benefits:
- You can come to any tutorial you like, without having to register on ..SI-Net (which, I think, won't let you register even if you want to).
- You have a choice of assessments.  You'll be able to choose from:
--> (1) the same two assignments as the other students
--> (2) the same assignments but with higher word limits
--> (3) one long essay.
-> You'll have to decide which option to go for around mid semester.  If in doubt, pick option (1).
