I'm not just playing for time (I may have been last time, but not this time!), but it seems to me like they're currently evolving ... so maybe you want to get rid of the "modified designs" part of what you just specified.

That's unless I'm misunderstanding what you mean by "epigenetic effects".  The way I understand the term, epigenetic effects are just as evolutionary as genetic effects.

Good question. Let's go with this: Their assembly lines will produce modified designs, but do so only through what we'd call "epigenetic" effects. So, changes in the environment cause the assembly lines to spit out different designs.

Ooh.  I like this.

The first thing I want to know is how they reproduce.  Probably they don't all reproduce the same way; but do any of their reproduction techniques include anything that suggests they're likely to evolve efficiently?  (Maybe some analogue of Weismann's barrier?)

[[[break]]]added at line 0: *lime {code Thought experiment:

Some day we get interstellar travel. We find planets far and wide with native life of varying forms. On one planet, we find robots. They're metal. They use solar and/or nuclear power. They may or may not have nanomachines regulating their smallest mechanical processes. There are millions of different models, all with many copies, all doing different things. There is no organic life on the planet. Like most alien life, we can't communicate with them, as the language differences are at present too great. 

The question:

How would we go about determining if these machines were "created" or "evolved"?
