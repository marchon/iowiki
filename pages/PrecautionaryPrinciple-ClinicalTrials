- a case in which the PP works really well: null hypotheses in clinical trials

Our novel proposal is to restrict the precautionary principle to specific, but very broad, concrete cases, including the case of newly developed pharmaceuticals, in which government authorities traditionally and rightly refrain from allowing populations to take a new drug unless and until it passes strict clinical trials.  As a philosopher and an authority on the methodology of clinical trials I am uniquely placed to contribute to this case study.
