Thinking about Backwards Causality and not being able to kill my grandmother in the past if she is alive now I began to think that if my actions now are 'affecting' my past self then wouldn't a future me be 'affecting' my present self? So reverse causality would be deterministic as anything I do now would be because of something I did in the future and just as I can't kill my grandmother my future is set.

Maybe I completely misunderstand this concept in which case you can either ignore me or tell me where I went wrong.
