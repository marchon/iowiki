# Is Mathematics Cumulative?

Well, the way most historians of science use "cumulative", no it isn't.  But that doesn't seem to capture the most interesting question.  So there's a really good topic here.

_official project summary_: This course will examine the question "Is mathematics cumulative?".  We will find deficiencies in the standard historians' definition of 'cumulative' and we will use mathematically interesting case studies to illuminate both this definition and the answer to the question of whether mathematics is cumulative.
