Imagine there are three people living in a house together.  There's the father, who is a typical, strict kind of father.  He in his early 60s and was in Vietnam.  His son, 25, is a bit of a tearaway and his father is trying to keep him from turning to a life of crime.  His daughter, 16, is in year 12 at highschool and still very much a child at heart.

One day, the son gets hold of a gun.  He got it from a "friend" and is planning to use it in some kind of armed robbery.  He's in the backyard of the house showing it off to his sister.  His sister takes the gun from him and fires it at a target.  Unfortunately, she misses the target and the bullet goes through the fence and hits a small boy on one of the neighbouring properties, killing him.

The daughter then runs into the house and tells the father what has happened.

Questions:

Should the father a) report the incident to the authorities, b) assist his son to try and cover it up, or c) stay out of it?

Should the son accept responsibility for what happened, and try and protect his sister?

Should the daughter accept responsibility for what happened, even if her brother is willing to cover for her?
