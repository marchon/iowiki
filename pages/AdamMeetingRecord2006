# Tuesday 21 Feb
Adam, Jason
Agenda: Jeffrey paper; statistical meaning of ``bias''
Discussed: Jeffrey review paper --- probably don't bother discussing Dorling in just a few words; instead give a few examples showing that this is only a good book for research, not for teaching; definition of ``bias'' is confusing; need to talk later about WHY people are confused about the meaning and (separately) the importance of bias
To do: Jason to finish commenting on the wiki page on Peto et al; Adam to play with the definition of bias

# Tuesday 28 Feb
Adam, Jason
Agenda: bias; overall project planning
Discussed: public health talk was a raging success; Jeffrey review almost done; bias
To do: refresh project proposal using stuff on wiki; write a paper on rofocoxib; think about WiP  seminar; write down some thoughts on bias while you can still see the duck

# Tuesday 14 March
Adam, Jason
Agenda: overall project planning; links between philosophy of probability and philosophy of science
Discussed: as above; new project outline is great
To do: look at Bas van Fraassen's papers on his web site etc.; read Berger and Sellke

# Wednesday 22 March
Adam, Jason
Agenda: look at jeffrey rv and start of rofecoxib; discuss project plan 
Discussed: new experimentalism; metaphysical underpinning of the distinction between classical and bayesian stats.
Remember Jason's diagram separating statistical methods - AL and JG differing separation but similar divide; continue exploring the divide along beleif in fact-of-the-matter so use error statistics + new experimentalism and the variety of evidence relating to many (infinite) hypotheses of bayesianism.  Consider how new experimentalism and bayesianism may fit together.

Adam, Jason
Discussed: Rofecoxib draft paper
To do: Adam to continue drafting

# Tuesday 18 July
Rofecoxib draft paper coming along better, thanks to decision to more or less leave Mayo out of it; will probably do a separate Mayo paper subsequently.  Sydney has offered a scholarship; just paperwork remains to be done.
To do: Adam continue drafting

# Friday 27 July
Invited to an important international conference.  Well done!
Paper progressing.  Current conclusion: classical statistics can't back up the inferences made in practice, even when they're sensible.  It (therefore?) can't play the role it claims to play in EBM.
To do: Think about p-value functions.

# Thursday 7 September
Worrall has commented on Rofecoxib paper.
To do: Jason to comment too!

# Tuesday 21 November
Update on where various projects are up to.  Currently completing presentation for Brussels; send for comment once done.  On return finalise rofecoxib paper draft. Next project ..---EBM, what must it be if it is going to make sense (and what it is almost definitely not)

# Monday 11 December
Economics/ethics paper presented in Europe: well done!  Possible follow-ups from that: (a) think about future work with economists; (b) email Andrew Thingy.
To do for the evidence workshop in January: think about presenting on (a) what EBM ought to be and/or (b) stuff about sub-studies case-control studies.  Probably (a), but put in stuff you already know backwards if you're having trouble thinking of enough to say about (a).
To do otherwise: submit short rofecoxib paper.

# Wednesday 20 December
Short rofecoxib paper submitted.  Long rofecoxib paper new draft due soon.
To do: finish next draft of rofecoxib paper.
