*purple I think what I wrote above was imprecise and didn't capture what I really wanted to say. So I'll try again. We define a space to be a manirift if the neighbourhood around any point in that space is homeomorphic to a _connected subset_ of R^n. The dimension of a point is the smallest n for which that point's neighbourhood can be embedded in R^n. The dimension of the manirift is the supremum of the dimensions of its points.

The subset idea is the key here. Although n-dimensional vector spaces are homeomorphic to R^n, their subsets may not be. For instance, the point in the middle of the infinity sign has a neighbourhood that is homeomorphic to a cross, which is not like R^n for any n, but it is like a connected subset of R^2. Jono.*

*green Like manifolds, for example? In differential topology and geometry you can look at general spaces that might "globally" be quite complicated, but "locally" look like Euclidean space. Then the dimension of the manifold is just taken to be m, where m is the maximum dimension of Euclidean space needed for any neighbourhood of the manifold to be mapped homeomorphically to. I'm not really sure how to explain that more in words and less in maths though...

*green While it's true that you can show that any point in n-dimensional Euclidean space (Rn) can be uniquely represented by a single real number (the real line R), it's not a useful representation at all.
The two sets have the same cardinality, which means there's a bijection between them, a one-to-one and onto relationship between these two sets of different dimension.
However, it can be proved (basic topology) that there's no homeomorphism between n-dimensional Euclidean space (Rn) and m-dimensional Euclidean space (Rm), unless n = m. That is, we can't get a "nice" (that is, continuous) representation between these two spaces of different dimension. So although we can represent any point in the plane by a point in the line, we can't move nicely  in the plane with this new, one-dimensional coordinate.

I have a question, mostly on topic (since you mentioned string theory). In the video posted by Lorenzo in the 10th dimension post, it says that the way they explained ten dimensions is not the way they are actually understood in string theory, but it was just a simple tool for laypeople to understand them. What is the way string theorists understand the ten dimensions? ... u4309050

[[[break]]]added at line 0: *lime {code *blue Just a musing for the maths kids...

The dimension of a space (such as a universe) is often defined in an intuitive way as the minimum number of coordinates required to uniquely locate any point in that space. For example, any point on a line can be uniquely located by a single (real) number and so lines are "one-dimensional". However, points in a plane or on the surface of a sphere seem to require two coordinates, and so these surfaces are "two-dimensional".

However, it seems to me that this definition is inadequate.

Using a little analysis, it is possible to show that any point on a Euclidean plane can be uniquely represented by a single real number. The same goes for Euclidean spaces of any finite dimension and for most non-Euclidean spaces too. (This is because non-Euclidean spaces that are reasonably well-behaved can be embedded inside higher-dimensional Euclidean spaces.)

So there seems to be a problem. You might respond that mapping points in a plane to single real numbers is not an "intuitive" coordinate system and that only intuitive systems should be allowed under our definition. However, it is easy to think of spaces for which two coordinate systems of different dimensions both seem intuitive.

Imagine, for instance, a universe shaped like a tuning fork or a cat-o'-nine-tails, but with thin lines. Would this space be one-dimensional or two/nine-dimensional? Both coordinate systems seem fairly intuitive to me.

Unfortunately, more rigorous definitions of dimension (such as the size of a minimum spanning set for vector spaces) seem to suffer from a lack of generality.

So the question is - is there a general, rigorous definition of dimension that matches up with our intuitions?
