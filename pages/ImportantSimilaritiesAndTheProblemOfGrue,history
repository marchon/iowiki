In many different contexts it seems that we want to give an account of what are important or essential elements of some kind of similarity judgement and those that are not.  This sort of problem arises when thinking about induction (What are important regularities?), about universals and/or tropes (What are the essential qualities that make up individual and how are they combined?) and when thinking about the structure of concepts (At least on the prototype view - how do we determine sufficiency of conditions for the application of a concept?). 

The problem(s) faced in all these cases seem to be well illustrated by Goodman's Grue paradox - there is a problem when one wants to move from dealing with particular instances to general accounts.
