We need a conceptual link between the case studies, or at least reasons for picking the case studies we do.   E.g., one where the PP works really well (clinical trials); one where whether it works depends on technological developments (nanotech?); one where whether it works depends on metaphysical or abstract issues (animals).

At most 3 case studies.

We'll need to at least mention standard environmental ethics cases.  Whether we can have a case study on that might depend on whether we have room on the project team for an enviro expert.  If not, can use an environmental nanotechnology case study.

- case in which the PP works really well: precautionary.principle-clinical.trials
- nanoethics case, possibly environmental, or possibly RoboAnts or RoboViruses: ``Robo-viruses or ants could nibble away at plaque in arteries. They could repair bad spots in valves. The problem is hat if they were too intelligent, the host could be in danger :)'' (ElaineOran)
- maybe the moral status of animals (see Bradshaw 1998, which I haven't read yet); could interest Singer etc.
