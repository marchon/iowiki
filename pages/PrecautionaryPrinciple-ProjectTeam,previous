- maybe Singer, Hadley
- PI: Mark Burgman, Head of the Australian Centre of Excellence for Risk Analysis: http://www.acera.unimelb.edu.au
In order to be a PI, Mark has to ``secure a significant contribution of cash, in-kind or other material resources''.  In-kind should be no problem.  Maybe even a small amount of cash would be possible.
- Possible PI from a clinical trials place, e.g. Max Parmar, head of Cancer Trials for the UK MRC; but the contribution might be a problem.
- Possible PI on nanotech.
