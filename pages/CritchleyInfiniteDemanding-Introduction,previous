*Summary*

- philosophy as beginning in disappointment
-- re: failure to discover knowledge of ..things-in-themselves, etc
- concerned with religious and political disappointment
-- religious: lack of experience of faith
--- => nihilism
-- political: realisation that world is unjust
--- what does justice involve in this world?
- active vs passive nihilism
-- active: everything meaningless but we can destroy it all and create something meaningful in its place
-- passive: everything meaningless and nothing we can do, so just focus on oneself
