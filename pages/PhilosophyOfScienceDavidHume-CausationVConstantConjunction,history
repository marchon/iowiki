[[[break]]]added at line 0: *lime {code As an empiricist, Hume thinks (rightly) that ideas can only exist in the mind that follow from perceptions of things in the world. Ideas follow from experience.

He argues that when we observe the world, we can never observe causation. We can see one thing that occurs after another thing - but we can never actually see or observe in any way 'causation'.

In short, he rejects the idea of causation as something that we've merely invented in our minds - not a phenomenon in the universe. He replaces it with the idea of constant conjunction. I.E, we always observe A following from B (A and B are in constant conjunction) but we can never truly say that A causes B.

This goes what science is doing. Constant conjunction permits testable hypothesis and allows science to make predictions. But it removes the ability to of science to explain the world. (Beyond a predictions being a form of explanation in themselves)

This link, inter alia, has some useful information on Hume and Causation.
