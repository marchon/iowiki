Because the gravitational forces acting within each galaxy would be enough to keep the galaxy together but the gravitational force between galaxies wouldn't be enough because of the sheer distance apart they are? ie all a result of the inverse square law

[[[break]]]added at line 0: *lime {code If the universe is expanding in the sense that the space between objects is stretching, does this mean that the space between the Earth and the sun is also stretching? If this is the case are we remaining close to the sun because of the gravitational force of the sun?
