[[[break]]]added at line 0: *lime {code Does EBM Suck?

Sackett's version of EBM does suck.  Just totally.

The rigid evidence hierarchy sucks.

Jason claims that Sackett / evidence hierarchy is what EBM is.  This requires a research project to document (i.e. to check whether Jason is right).

Two possible conclusions, which we'll write up as dissenting opinions:

ADAM: Here is what EBM* is.  EBM* is what EBM will have to be.

JASON: There is no way to rescue evidence hierarchies.

These views are not quite as different as they might seem (although they are different).
