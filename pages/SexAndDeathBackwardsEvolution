I mentioned a recent New Scientist article (13 January 2007) on this subject in the last class. A couple of quotes from it will give some idea of the content and what the article is on about. 

"... as more example [of 'evolutionary throwbacks'] come to light and modern genetics enters the scene, that principle [i.e. 'evolution cannot run backwards'] is having to be rewritten. Not only are evolutionary throwbacks possible, they sometimes play an important role in the forward march of evolution." p. 29. 

"In 1994, Richard Raff and colleagues at Indiana University in Bloomington decided to use genetics to put a number on the probability of evolution going into reverse. ... Silent genes accumulate random mutations, they reasoned, eventually rendering them useless. ... The team calculated that there is a good chance of silent genes surviving for up to 6 million years in a least a few individuals in a population." p. 29. 

There's lots of talk about atavisms - what the article defines as the technical term for "evolutionary throwbacks". The articles cites the journal Nature, and quotes Bernhard Herrmann of the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics in Berlin. It all appears very scientific. 

But in the light of what we were talking about in the last class, I can't help but think that the article contradicts everything that we discussed. I'm scientifically naive, I admit, but to me the whole article seems to misinterpret evolution. Has anybody else read it? The article concludes: "If humans ever have to return to the trees, our long-lost tails may be returning with us." It disturbs me that an article like this has appeared in a "scientific" publication.

I've never ever been satisfied with New Scientist's discussion of any topic. It's articles relating to anything quantum have been particularly bad. Of course the communication of science to the lay man is a very difficult venture, considering that a lot of very difficult and often heavily mathematical ideas have to be simplified. A lot of important details get lost in this manner.

I agree with both of you.

One particularly bad habit the New Scientist has, in my experience, is publishing articles announcing a new discovery or trend which is actually ages old.  They did it a few years ago with epigenetic evolution, which is an idea which is as old as the hills but which New Scientist announced as if it had just been discovered.  (See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics ... I haven't actually read that, but I thought you might want an online definition, and from a quick skim it looks good.)

Go on, New Scientist dudes, sue us!  (Just kidding.  Please don't sue us.)

They're just sprucing up an interesting idea by making it seem controversial to really basic principles when it's not, at least as is implied. They seem to do it more and more. It reminds me of the taglines and pictures on the front of my housemates' glossy tabloid mags, suggesting some hugely scandalous celebrity behaviour; upon 'reading' the article it's made obvious to anyone critical enough to care that it was grossly missuggestive and out of context.

More seriously though, I think it's worth pointing out that this is an example of the general issue I raised in the last lecture, that of the ambiguities inherent in many of the words we use to talk about evolution. By using ordinary language of intention or purpose or progress to describe a theory-structure within which such notions have a specific technical meaning, if any at all, we make it easy to it get into a situation where we can't translate between the useful and more pleasing metaphors and the dry, more cumbersome but more scientifically accurate theory. Which the Tv audience typically doesn't even realise it has to be able to if it is going to talk sensibly about it. But even among philosophers and biologists, who would claim it as an easy habit of thought, it makes a space for assumptions that might not be expressed but certainly need to be scrutinized. People like Dawkins make a big deal about unclear conceptions of the basic structure of evolution. Though I think even he sometimes slips up.

Yes, even Dawkins sometimes slips up, which supports your point nicely.  In fact, according to linguist Kathryn Tuckwell at Macquarie University, he slips up all the time.  She has a detailed study of exactly this issue.  I'll ask her to come and talk to us about it if she's ever in Canberra.

Dick concludes by saying he thinks the New Scientists article (from the 13 Jan 07, pg. 28) is contradicted by the ideas of the first two lectures.

Let me first state what I thought the major points of the first two lectures were.  Perhaps Jason can correct me if I have it wrong:

(1)	The first lecture discussed how, when discussing evolutionary ‘fitness’, local optima cannot be global optima because environments change. *blue Right ... and tend not to be global optima anyway for other reasons. Jason*

(2)	The second lecture focused on the fact that “ideal” genotypes may be unattainable because of the mechanics of genetics.  Furthermore, in some circumstances, “super-being” genotypes perish because heterogeneous offspring of the super-being have a reduced fitness. *blue Right ... and can be wiped out for other reasons too, e.g. are often wiped out just by bad luck before having time to reach large numbers.  Jason*

I fail to see how either of these points contradicts the New Scientist article.  The article merely points out that silent genes (like those for human tails) may once again be expressed if the correct selective pressures are met.  Yes, some mutations would be necessary, but it is entirely feasible for these mutations to occur.

Note that by “evolution running backwards”, the article is not suggesting that a branch of humanity will ‘devolve’ into primitive hominoids.  But there is nothing to stop previously rare “avatar” characteristics (like extra nipples) becoming more common if the environment makes such individuals fitter than the rest of the population.  

I do agree that the phrase “evolution running backwards” is a sloppy one though – avatarism is really evolution running forwards, just along a previously beaten path.  I recommend the review articles in the journals 'Nature', 'Science' and 'Cell' as being more likely to avoid such sloppiness.  

Dick, is this response fair?  Or have I entirely missed the contradiction you mention between the lecture material and the New Scientist article?

I still think you're both right!

Based on what Dick says about the New Scientist article (which I haven't actually read), I think you're right, Morgan, to say that it doesn't contradict what you call the main points of our classes.  But it does contradict some of the other points.

In particular, Dick says the New Scientist says "... as more example [of 'evolutionary throwbacks'] come to light and modern genetics enters the scene, that principle [i.e. 'evolution cannot run backwards'] is having to be rewritten."  Now, I don't think that principle has been taken seriously in evolutionary theory in the last 50 years at least.  It's certainly a very long way from being the sort of consensus that it would have to be for the quote from the New Scientist to be reasonable.  And one of the main reasons for it not being a consensus is that people these days mostly think of evolution as having no direction at all (apart from maybe  in some very vague sense indeed).

P.S. I asked John Wilkins about this.  He's a philosopher of evolutionary biology who writes the excellent Evolving Thoughts blog at http://scienceblogs.com/evolvingthoughts.

He says:

Dollo's Rule is the principle that the livelihoods of an *entire* genome or phenotype being reverted to are vanishingly small, not that particular genes or developmental sequences cannot be reactivated. Phylogenetic inertia, as it is sometimes called (I prefer plesiomorphic retention, myself) is the principle that developmental sequences and genes will be retained until genetic drift and mutation eliminates them as viable candidates. This means that, for instance, if an open reading frame is interrupted or loses its initiation sequence and becomes unexpressed, there is a non-zero chance that it may be reactivated by an inverse mutation. The functional sequence space is pretty large, so the chances that even a degraded sequence will be viable are reasonable, if low.

Atavisms are typically reactivations of developmental sequences (such as the expression of retinoic acid that plays a role in digit formation, for instance, or the expression of bone morphogenetic protein that builds longer bones at the growth boundary in development) which have been suppressed. By losing the suppressory regulation, the sequence can become active, so long as it doesn't cause too many epistatically linked perturbations of the "modern" developmental sequence.

Consider that a novel development - say, cetacean loss of hindlimbs - is likely overlaid on an ancestral sequence rather than by the complete reorganisation of that sequence. A gene that suppresses the expression of the same developmental module that expresses as forelimbs is a little less stable and embedded than that module. It can be randomly displaced, hence the atavism (human tails are another example - the sequence is at least 20 million years old since the development of apes, but it can be impeded by mutations or accidents of development and the older sequence reactivated).

I agree with your comments about the content of the lecture, Morgan. I was thinking more about the import of some of the discussion that took place. Our differences just go to show that what we take away from a class is influenced, to some extent, by what we take into it! *blue [Maybe that's a good thing. It's certainly what I expect. Jason]*  I have problems with the concept of teleology in biology, so any time I hear something that resonates with my preconceptions, I tend to pick up on it.

Jason, many thanks for your input. I have become an avid reader of John Wilkins' blog, thanks to the link you put up under Further Reading.

I'm very much a tyro at this philosophy of science/biology lark, and also very much a tyro at online discussion. I hope to rectify both states of affairs.

To this end, I am starting another topic - SexAndDeath.Teleology.in.Biology - so that I can start learning a bit more about that subject. As I said, all this is mostly new to me.
