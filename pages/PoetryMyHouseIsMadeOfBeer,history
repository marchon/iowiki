Making the most of the materials that you have at hand is the spirit of being eco friendly, and this house that has been made from beer cans certainly lives up to the green spirit._

_However although the idea may seem to be great at first, there would appear to be some logistics involved, like where do all of the cans come from etc?_

_But if you have managed to collect enough beer cans, make sure that you remember that cans are not that strong and these will be exposed to the elements._
