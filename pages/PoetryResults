Thanks

when exactly would be get our essay 2 and 3 marks back?
----
*green MATH1007 students: If you've been coming to the tutorials, you had your essay 2 mark back ages ago.  If not, look on WebCT.

Your essay 3 will be available for you to pick up at the Maths Department reception desk tomorrow, probably late morning.  You can keep it (unlike the earlier essays).  It will have your mark and some comments.  If it's not there, or if you've got any questions about the comments, please email me.*

*red PHIL2058 students: If you've been coming to the tutorials, you had your essay 2 mark back ages ago.  If not, email me.

Essay 3 marks are on WebCT.

Your essay 3 is available for you to pick up from me.  I'll email you soon with some times when I'll definitely be in my office.  If you don't want to wait for the email, you're welcome to pop by and hope to catch me in.  My office is ..A.D. Hope Building room 112.*

*blue All students: Your overall mark, including your participation mark, won't be available until the Faculty has signed off on it.  Then I guess you'll get it on ISIS.  If you're really worried, I can give you a provisional idea of what your overall mark is likely to be by email.

*green is there any way you could perhaps post marks online? say in webct? I'm interstate so i dont have the opportunity to come in and collect things.*

MATH1007 essay 3 results are going onto WebCT, or may already be there (I can't check).  PHIL2058 results are now on WebCT too.  Jason

i'm a math student, and i've been to every tutorial. however, i have no received my essay 2 marks, nor is it listed on my webct.

Did you put your name on it? You haven't put your name on this. Who are you?

It's OK: I know who it was, & it's sorted.
