If the universe is expanding in the sense that the space between objects is stretching, does this mean that the space between the Earth and the sun is also stretching? If this is the case are we remaining close to the sun because of the gravitational force of the sun?

*blue Yes, and yes.

But the overall expansion of the universe is so slow, when scaled down to the size of the Solar System, that it doesn't affect the distance between the Earth and the Sun much at all.  By the time the expansion of the universe has much effect at this scale, the Sun will long ago have swallowed up the Earth and burnt it to a crisp :--(

*pink I've never thought of that! Could it be that the galaxies are moving away from each other, creating more 'empty' space in between?
Because the gravitational forces acting within each galaxy would be enough to keep the galaxy together but the gravitational force between galaxies wouldn't be enough because of the sheer distance apart they are? ie all a result of the inverse square law

*blue The gravitational force between galaxies is very significant.  And so is the expansion of the universe, creating space between the galaxies.  For galaxies which are close together, gravity wins.  For galaxies which are far apart, nobody knows yet which will win in the long run.  Place your bets.

*pink Thats cool! since we're talking such large numbers, how far is "far apart" and how close is "close together" approximately speaking?
Tegan*

*blue Good question!  There are some nice maps which answer your question at http://www.astro.princeton.edu/~mjuric/universe/.  To read the scale, you need to know that a Megaparsec is about 3 million light years.

*orange If we're placing bets, my money (what little of it there is) is on gravity and the super-massive black holes, to take it out...but only by a singularity - Hamish*

*red Let us consider for a moment a spherical cow.....unfortunately the universe will never be as simple as this so unless you plan on living for the next 400 billion years or so to see how it all plans out (or find that guy who has already determined everything because human's supposedly have no free will) then i guess betting is prity irrelevant in this case! Ah what the hell... I'd probably bet with Hamish, no matter what you say, a force from a theory named as a mockery by a whinging yorkshireman (Fred Hoyle) cannot beat out, as James May would put it, "the most powerful engine in the universe".*
