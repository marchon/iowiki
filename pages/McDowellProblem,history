In Mind and World ..McDowell is primarily concerned with the nature of our intentional mental states (those mental states directed towards the world).  In particular he wants to demonstrate how we can give a philosophical account of these states that doesn't leave us either spinning in frictionless void (i.e. where the way the world is doesn't have any impact on our intentional states) or remove freedom from our intentionality by positing that we are "forced" into our intentional states by the way the world is.  In a slogan: we want freedom with friction.

* Is intentionality the right way to phrase this problem?  Is ..McDowell actually concerned with some subset of these states?  If so, what defines this subset?
}*[[[break]]]to: *green {code In Mind and World ..McDowell is primarily concerned with the nature of the interaction of our spontaneity (i.e. our mental states to do with meaning, intentionality and normativity) and the world.  In particular he wants to demonstrate how we can give a philosophical account of this interaction that doesn't either leave us spinning in frictionless void (i.e. where the way the world is doesn't has bearing on our spontaneity) or remove the freedom of our spontaneity by positing that we are "forced" into certain mental states simply by virtue of the way the world is (i.e. that we have some sort of "border" beliefs about the world that are forced upon us by the way the world is).  In a slogan: we want freedom (to act) with friction (with the world).
