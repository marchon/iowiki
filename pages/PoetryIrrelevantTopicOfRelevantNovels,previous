*red I know this isn’t strictly the purpose of this discussion board, but considering the liberal nature of this course, I thought it might be ok.

Last term Jason gave us a short story by Greg Egan with the direction of time as a central part of the plot. 

Does anyone else have a love of hard science fiction? Can anyone suggest a novel or two that relate to topics covered in this course?

I raise the topic mainly because i read a very short story by Asimov called "the last question" this afternoon 
(http://www.multivax.com/last_question.html) that relating to entropy, and how to reverse it, and I feel compelled to tell everyone about it.

Thoughts? Input? Claims of irrelevance?

``The Black Cloud'' and ``A for Andromeda'' by Fred Hoyle.
Anything else by Greg Egan really, except for his very earliest short stories.  There's some free stuff on his personal web site.
Those two authors are the most relevant to the course, of the ones I know.
Anything by Stanislaw Lem.
Most things by Arthur C. Clarke (RIP), especially ``Childhood's End''.
``The Story of a Brain'' by Arnold Zuboff --- see PoetryBiologicalVTechnological-Progeny.
Then for literary merit (if that's relevant!), although not much related to this course, Iain M. Banks.  He rocks.

I should also put Snow Crash by Neil Stephenson in, which talks a lot about the Sumerians (earliest known civilisation) and their understanding of language as effecting the world they perceive, rather than vice versa, as we see the world. Their language was completely isolated from that which preceded ours and if there were a civilisation that would come up with completely different physical laws for the world, it would probably be them. 

The story uses it as an analogy to talk about virtual computerised worlds directly affecting our perceived real world (if those are the right terms). I was thinking about it when we were talking about different methods of modelling physics in the Wednesday tute this week, but everyone was so excited it was hard to find a spot for it in the conversation where it would be anything more than interesting.

*red Here are two of my favourite HG Wells short stories too. Neither relate to the course but both are fantastic, Aepyornis Island http://www.online-literature.com/wellshg/1/ about a mans companionship with a gigantic bird on a deserted island, and The Truth About Pyecraft http://www.online-literature.com/wellshg/20/ about a man who discovers a magical potion which allows him to rapidly lose weight.

More Greg Egan:
-- I'm handing out a section of one of his books which might be useful for the final assignment if you're doing the question on life (and if it's not too late).  If you're not coming to the final tutorial but you'd like a copy, see whether you can find me in my office (A.D. Hope 112).
-- There's an excellent new Greg Egan story at http://www.asimovs.com/_issue_0805/DarkINtegers.shtml.
