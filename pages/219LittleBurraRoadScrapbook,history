- The septic tank is biocycle without aeration.  It can be fed Actizyme from time to time (maybe about once a month, just to be on the safe side?).
- our dishwasher model uses about 25 litres per normal wash and exactly the same for its economy cycle (presumably it uses lower heat therefore less electricity)
- things we need for fencing:
-- netting clips
-- clipper
-- gripples
-- grippler
-- land, lots of land, under starry skies above

- If the water level in the top tank stays low for too long the concrete will dry out and crack, then it won’t hold water properly any more.   Just remember to switch all the taps to the house water (in the shed) OFF and open the tap on the bottom tank before you start the pump.  Make sure there is water flowing through the pump (you can walk up the hill to make sure there is water going into the top tank).  This is important as, if the pump runs dry for more than a couple of minutes it will break down irretrievably.
