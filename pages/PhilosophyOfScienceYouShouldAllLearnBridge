*black Why should you learn bridge?*



*red - Provides a new medium for an infinite variety of puzzles for those that like solving logic problems*

*orange - Playing bridge regularly is associated with a smaller risk of dementia when you get older (a study is about to start)*

- It's fun!

- It's really not that hard ... you can decide for yourself how deep you want to go into it. If you want it to be a relaxing game with not much effort, so be it, if you want to think deeply and hard and flex the mental muscles, you can choose that too. 

- The stereotype is that it's hard to learn, but it really isn't. Becoming a bridge player is a very gradual slope, and you set the degree of the slope (or make it a plane)

*green - The basic rules are actually much simpler that 500*

*blue - Playing it for a while will significant'y improve your problem solving skills and analytic and logical thinking in every other area of life*

*purple - So many people play bridge both just for fun and much more seriously that you can play it at whatever level you like, and meet loads and loads of intelligent people really easily.*

*red - There aren't many youth players (the reason bridge is associated with old people is because it was a normal thing for everyone to do 40 years ago, so those people have carried over. It's not the normal thing nowadays) so getting into the national or state team is somewhat easier than very popular sports like soccer or basketball. If you do, you get free trips around Australia and the world.*

*orange - You are intelligent people, and intelligent people need exercise for the mind if you don't want it to dwindle (uni can only do so much) just like sport freaks need exercise for their bodies or they'll dwindle*

*green The Canberra bridge scene is meeting at the Wig & Pen on Sunday 30 March from 2pm onwards for some social bridge if you want to join in/learn. Otherwise, regular meetings are at noon on tuesdays in the Asian Bistro.*
