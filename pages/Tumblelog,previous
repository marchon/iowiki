I've made local copies of a couple of their terrific slide shows.  These are about the USA.  But almost everything they say applies to Australia as well.

Rinalia took this photo and captioned it ``Louise wondering if I might give her some food''.

http://gallery.xeny.net/gallery2/images/d/217-4/Louise-wondering.jpg

I hope y'all realise that Louise is not really wondering, only moving her body in a way which we anthropomorphically interpret as wondering. Don't worry, I'm joking. :--) You know how according to most people (or most people I meet, anyway), non-human animals are just like humans except that when humans do something it's called thinking, believing etc, and when non-humans do exactly the same thing it's called instinct? Makes me want to instinctively hit them over the head with something heavy.

``Hockey Moms'' were out in force for Sarah Palin last night ... at least that's the impression the Republicans wanted you to have. Last night, I went to the Republican National Convention mainly to see how it differed from festivities in Denver, and boy was it different. Probably one of the most notable things was the Republican use of ``handmade'' signs. You couldn't enter the Xcel Center with a handmade sign, but that's ok ... when you got inside and got to a seat, there were handmade signs waiting for you.

Last week I was at dinner at the house of some lovely but omnivorous friends, who had kindly cooked vegan dishes for me and Alison but were eating meat as well.

Their meat was very dry, and they were complaining about it.  Oh, if only they had some meat fat to baste it with, they were saying.

``I know where you could get some suitable fat,'' I said.  ``Liposuction.''

Cheered me up no end.

SunirShar on blogs versus wikis:

``I have a new appreciation for blogging. I have come around to seeing how blogging is superior to wikis for efficiently participating in a conversation with other people, even though the conversation never coalesces on importance. Joining a conversation is way more important because it's necessary to PersonalRelationships, which are more important than actual truth. Twitter is amazing for this because it strips away the pretense of saying anything important. You just have to be saying something to somebody. 

I think it's interesting that blogs out-perform wikis for conversations and relationship-building because blogs rely heavily on the technical infrastructure built up around them in order to support conversations, whereas wikis seem to only thrive when the participants focus heavily on the network of PersonalRelationships between themselves. Looking back at this outcome, I have shifted my belief that culture is more powerful than form. 

It's not that I don't think a strong culture will dominate any form. It's just that I now think of the expense of culture. The cost of maintaining a culture is so high, the most effective approach is to solidify culture in external artifacts that represent what was previously embedded in the relationships between people and the people themselves.''

_Thanks to John Hurst from Monash Uni for this true story:_

Hey!  I had a streaker in my FIT2022 lecture today (12-1).

I was happily into the gruesome bits of stack frames, pushing and popping return addresses, parameters, etc, with a slide entitled "Stack Growth in Procedure Calls" when the door burst open, and this male streaker ran through the lecture theatre, up the stairs and out the back door.  He was shouting about something going on somewhere, but I don't think many students were taking much notice of the mouth end of his anatomy.

He disappeared as quickly as he appeared, and to rescue all the jaws from the desks, I quipped "Well!  I didn't see much stack growth there!"  - which drew one of the biggest laughs I've had for many a while ...

cheers,

News story written by Associated Press and spotted by Chris Cléirigh:

When Yosuke the parrot flew out of his cage and got lost, he did exactly what he had been taught --- recite his name and address to a stranger willing to help.

Police rescued the African grey parrot two weeks ago from a neighbor's roof in the city of Nagareyama, near Tokyo. After spending a night at the station, he was transferred to a nearby veterinary hospital while police searched for clues, local policeman Shinjiro Uemura said.

He kept mum with the cops, but began chatting after a few days with the vet.

"I'm Mr. Yosuke Nakamura," the bird told the veterinarian, according to Uemura. The parrot also provided his full home address, down to the street number, and even entertained the hospital staff by singing songs.

"We checked the address, and what do you know, a Nakamura family really lived there. So we told them we've found Yosuke," Uemura said.

The Nakamura family told police they had been teaching the bird its name and address for about two years.

But Yosuke apparently wasn't keen on opening up to police officials.

"I tried to be friendly and talked to him, but he completely ignored me," Uemura said.

Everyone's talking about PZ Myers getting kicked out of an anti-evolution film recently while his guest, Richard Dawkins, was allowed in.

Jeremy Bentham was a dude.  How about this?

--> ``By the word paraphrasis may be designated that sort of exposition which may be afforded by transmuting into a proposition, having for its subject some real entity, a proposition which has not for its subject any other than a fictitious entity''

Doesn't that sound just like what Russell's supposed to have invented 70 years after Bentham died?

Citation: Jeremy Bentham, ``Essay on Logic'', in _The Works of Jeremy Bentham_, ed. J. Bowring, Edinburgh, 1843, Vol. 8, pp. 213--293 (p. 246), quoted in Michael Beaney, ``The Analytic Turn in Early ..Twentieth-Century Philosophy'', in Michael Beaney, ed., _The Analytic Turn_, London: Routledge, 2007, pp. 1--30.

Another thing I've just discovered is another very early utilitarian who believed in animal welfare (as Bentham did), namely ... amazingly ... Bolzano!  OK, that won't be amazing to everyone, but Bolzano is mainly famous as a mathematician, e.g. for the ..Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem.

I wish someone would write the perfect word processing system.  Word sucks the most, but sometimes TeX sucks too.

After *years* of using TeX to make lecture slides, I've only just found out why my small text usually comes out widely spaced.  Apparently you're not meant to use \raggedright with multiple fonts.  Did you know that?

(See TexScrapbook if you're interested in the details, including what to do about it.)

Funnily enough, just a couple of hours after writing that, I came across what looks like a rational successor to TeX.  It's called ``ant'' (``ant is not TeX'').  See http://ant.berlios.de.  I haven't got time to learn how to use it, sadly.

#Asymptotics
I'm getting increasingly cranky about statistics textbooks which write

-->lim (x&#8594;&#8734;) [a - b] = 0

and then explain that this means that as x increases a ``gets closer and closer to'' b (actual quote; citation omitted to protect the guilty).  Of course it doesn't mean that!

At least, it doesn't mean that in general (and meaning things in general is, er, meant to be the whole point of maths).  It does in the examples the author has in mind, but if *that's* what the author wants to say then the mathematics that goes into proving the asymptotic result is irrelevant.  The best one can say, if all one has is the asymptotic result, is that it's a clue that for actual values of x, as x increases, a is *likely* to get closer and closer to b.  It's only above *some* large value of x, unknown, that a is guaranteed to get closer to b.

Elsewhere I'm rebutting this sort of thing in detail for a couple of specific cases (unbiasedness and consistency of estimators, in case you're interested, both of which have asymptotic definitions).  But I'm cranky about almost all asymptotic definitions in statistics, not just those two.  And maybe almost all asymptotic definitions in applied maths, come to think of it.

#Hooray for Danya Alexeyevsky
For years, my wiki program --- the one which runs this site --- has only worked with an old version of the Io programming language, which has lead to various problems.  Now you may think that nobody reads this site (that's sort of a joke), but Danya Alexeyevsky not only reads it but has massively improved it by updating the program to work with the latest version of Io.  Or at least, they've done that with a slightly old version of my program (my fault: I hadn't made the latest version available), but now that Danya's done the hard part it will be relatively easy to get the latest version of my program working with the latest version of Io, and then everything will be good.

One day there might even be more than one site using this program.  And that might be a good thing, because even though I'm one of the world's crappest programmers I think I've got the _design_ of this wiki (by which I really mean its _feature set_) just about right.  And it's a small program, so it shouldn't be hard to get most of the bugs out later.
