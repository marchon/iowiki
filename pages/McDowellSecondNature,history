[[[break]]]added at line 8: *lime {code Another important point is the link ..McDowell draws between second nature and language.  For him, the primary function of our natural language is as a "repository of tradition" (i.e. a major component of what contributes to our second nature).

Also, the Bildung via which our second nature is formed is a key part of ..McDowell's "naturalised platonism."  It is the social nature of this Bildung that enables it to transcend the animal individual in a way that does not lead to "rampant platonism."

I guess we need to deal with two parts here: a description the concept of second nature as ..McDowell conceives of it and a description of its role in his argument (although at some stage it might be interesting to look at what use the concept could be put to if one lifts it out of ..McDowell's context).
