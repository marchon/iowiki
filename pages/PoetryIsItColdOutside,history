*red The air air pressure made me giggle. Its so rediculously low it indicates nothing of remote usefullness in terms of weather. To me at least. Maybe someone with a masters in xenometeorology. That'd be what they'd call it right? kind of a niche career path there...

[[[break]]]added at line 0: *lime {code *blue There are many ways of checking the weather these days...

Look outside the window.
Watch the last 5 minutes of the news.
Look up the weather on the net.
Get it burned onto your toast in the morning... no seriously...

*blue a little bizarre but it still has its limits... you can only check the weather near you... what do you do say, if you want to know weather its sunny or stormy... on MARS!

well, thanks to Phoenix, all you have to do is go along to {http://www.space.gc.ca/asc/eng/exploration/phoenix_weather1.asp} and have a look. 

You can even download a Widget for your desktop so you kept up to date with our celestial neighbour's forecast, but with a recent minimum of -80 and a Maximun of -35, you may want to pack a winter jacket or 2.*
