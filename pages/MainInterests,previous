My research is in two main areas:
* philosophy of statistical inference, with some sidelines in philosophy of probability and other parts of mathematics;
* applications of philosophy of science to research policy, especially as it affects ..Evidence-Based Medicine.

See main.interests.chatty.version for a 5-minute talk on my interests from July 2007.
See work.in.progress for online material.

When teaching, I specialise in philosophy of science.  But more specifically, I've taught:
* philosophy of cosmology
* ethics
* decision theory
* philosophy of mind
* logic
* general philosophy of science, especially realism
* history of analytic philosophy
* philosophy of probability and statistics
* philosophy of medicine
* philosophy and sociology of biology
* philosophy and sociology of information technology
* exobiology
and (as ..one-offs) a few other areas.  For more detail, see philosophy.courses.  .Jason
