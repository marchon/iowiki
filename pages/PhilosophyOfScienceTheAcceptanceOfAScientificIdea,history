*purple Hello all, I love those quotes and the associated discussion, it got me wondering... 

(I have quite limited background in chemistry and planetary geology/physics so any corrections here are especially appreciated)

Sammy said:*
*black I guess this came as a shock to me at first, but only because I know certain things about geology and plate tectonics that these earlier scientists did not.*

*purple The sorts of things I'm imagining are: Matching rock strata; plate boundary activities; GPS data. I think there are good reasons for believing these things, so I can understand why you said 'I know'. 

So I was thinking: Both plate tectonic theory and molecular orbital theory seem pretty well justified in my limited understanding. In each case, as far as I'm aware, there are many instances of many types of supporting evidence and nothing substantial in the way of inconsistent evidence. However, each does involve things we have to imagine, or represent via technologies, rather than experiencing in a more direct sense (pardon the pun).

In plate tectonic theory we have to imagine or try to represent with seismometers or whatever, the Earth's core where the heat for convection currents in the mantle come from. So the theory rests in part on something we postulate without being able to 'sense'.

In molecular orbital theory we have to imagine or try to represent with spectroscopes, or electron microscopes or whatever, the very molecules that are fundamental to the theory. So it rests essentially in something that we postulate without being able to resolve with our senses.

If I haven't stuffed up seriously here then I have the following questions:

Do people think it matters that we don't experience them directly (considering that our senses can decieve anyway)?

If it matters: How much and why?

Is it more reasonable to 'know' plate tectonic theory is right; or molecular orbital theory?

Hamish*

I specifically found this quote to be useful when applying it to the theory of Continental Drift. Prior to this course, I believe I took many scientific 'theories', such as Continental Drift, for granted. I don't necessarily see this as a bad thing, as many of these 'theories' have generated lots of evidence in their support since their development. However, in preparing for answering the first essay question, I have come to realise that many scientists did find the idea of drifting/moving continents 'nonsense' initially. From what I have read, the idea was "rejected by the vast majority of the scientific community" (Tarbauck & Lutgens, 2006), despite being hotly debated amongst them. I guess this came as a shock to me at first, but only because I know certain things about geology and plate tectonics that these earlier scientists did not.

On another note, Tarbauck & Lutgens' textbook, _Earth Science_ surprised me by using the Kuhnian term 'Scientific Revolution' to refer to the theory of continential drift. So Kuhn really did influence scientific thinking and termonology more than I was giving him credit for! (And I believe someone else has mentioned this in another Discussion, although I cannot remmeber who and which one...)

[[[break]]]added at line 21: *lime {code Sammy, that's an awesome quote. I was thinking about it though and to me it seems that it is only really the case for scientific revolutions (in the Khunian sense). On the other hand I think that when scientists are doing normal science (working within or extending the success of a paradigm), the new ideas and explanations they come up with are almost considered a priori to be valid. That's the feeling i get from thinking about my experience with chemistry any way. If i propose a new mechanism by which two molecules can interact that draws on all the accepted characteristics of my field's paradigm then i think it is unlikely people would straight out think it nonsense. Instead, since i'm following the 'rules' as to how people accept molecules should behave, i can imagine the scientific cogs in my paradigm would just keep on ticking over.
}*[[[break]]]added at line 22: *lime {code If on the other hand i proposed a new mechanism by which two molecules could interact that had, say, 5 bonds going to carbon (a MASSIVE no no), then people would of course treat my proposal as nonsense. If there continued to be problems with the relevant accepted paradigm (if i could disprove molecular orbital theory for example) and there indeed was a revolutionary paradigm shift then i'm sure the barnacles in the research school would go through a similar cavalcade of emotions to the ones from your quote!

The Acceptance of a Scientific Idea
J B S Haldane 
Its from: Journal of Genetics (58), 464, (1963)
But I found it in: R.L Webber's (1982) 'More Random Walks in Science'

"Professor J B S Haldane described the normal process of acceptance of a scientific idea, in four stages:

(i) this is worthless nonsense;
(ii) this is an interesting, but perverse, point of view;
(iii) this is true, but quite unimportant;
(iv) I always said so."

This made me laugh at first, but I do agree with the statement. I've found it to be quite useful while thinking about things raised in the course, such as Kuhn's paradigm shifts.

Any comments?
