}*[[[break]]]to: *green {code -- doesn't seem they can, so perhaps a more reasonable characterisation of the realist is via their belief in ..evidence-transcendence (ET) with bivalence coming in when vagueness is not an issue?
- but not at all clear that scientific realist is stuck with ET
- 3 kinds of objectivity:
-- truth: may have intelligibility without having cognitive capacity to determine ..truth-value
-- meaning: meaning of a statement as a real constraint
--- note: obj truth => obj meaning but maybe not <=
-- judgement: statements that are attempting to deal with independent features of the world (i.e. outcome of judgements not entirely determined by the judge)
--- again obj truth => obj judgement

[[[break]]]changed line 12 from: *orange {code 
}*[[[break]]]to: *green {code - Realism: 
-- able to form the right concepts re: features of the world
-- can come to know true statements about the world (involving the above concepts)
- Scepticism: doesn't dispute existence, rather ability to grasp truths.
- Idealism: realist misunderstands nature of truth, it is all of our own making.
- Dummett as still concerned with misunderstandings re: truth but not in all cases.
- at issue: can truth transcend evidence?
- how does this connect to traditional realist debates?
-- i.e. how does it lead to a questioning of the fit of our beliefs with the world?
--- seems we can have this fit without transcendence
- Dummett: key point is that realist believes in unrestricted bivalence.
-- how then is the realist to account for vagueness?
-- doesn't seem they can, so perhaps a more reasonable characterisation of the realist is via their belief in ..evidence-transcendence (ET)?
