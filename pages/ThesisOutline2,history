# EBM: Evolution, revolution or illusion

* Informal abstract: A philosophical framework for EBM is yet to be provided.  Worse.  Piecing together what has been put forward as a justification for EBM (and its hierarchy) is inconsistent.  I aim (i) to show that the framework provided by EBM proponents is inconsistent and (ii) provide a defensible philosophical framework for EBM (iii) show that the defensible framework provided in (ii) can't do half of the things EBM proponents have suggested EBM can do; with special emphasis on the fact that it does *NOT* do well in informing therapeutic decisions (the very aim of EBM).

#Introduction
Lay out the approach, and the main problems I will address.  Main problems to be addressed: (i) there is currently no defensible interpretation of the hierarchy; (ii) the intractable problems that exist for EBM if theory (..i.e. basic science) is ignored and (iii) the dilemma of external validity.  These are all interlinked.  The intro will aim to tell this in a nice story.

#Section 1 What is EBM?

#Chapter 1: EBM can't be
There is not an unambiguous interpretation of EBM provided in the clinical  literature.  As much as an interpretation is provided, however, proponents suggest a _categorical interpretation_.  The categorical interpretation holds that *all* the results of randomised trials *always* trumps evidence from lower down the hierarchy when it comes to informing therapeutic decisions. I show that this interpretation can not hold.

#Chapter 2: EBM must be
This chapter explores the arguments that have been provided in the clinical literature.  Consistent with other philosophical treatments it shows that the justifications provided in the clinical literature do not justify the ambitious claims made by EBM on behalf of the hierarchy.  Given this finding, I change tack.  I ask what claims *are* substantiated by the arguments provided in the clinical literature.  In particular, I focus on the argument that EBM's hierarchy can be defended by viewing it has a hierarchy of internal validity.  I show that if the hierarchy is  interpreted in this way the claims of EBM need to be limited to: therapeutic decisions, primary hypothesis tests and internal validity.  This approach highlights the _additional_ questions that need to be addressed before clinical research can inform therapeutic questions.

#Chapter 3: Why randomise
Here I look at more depth at a justification for randomisation in clinical trials.  In particular, I argue against Worrall's claim that providing the groups are adequately matched according to background knowledge, there is no epistemic distinction between randomised and non-randomised studies.

#Chapter 4: Introducing the dilemma of external validity
I introduce the challenge of external validity to EBM.  I show that informing therapeutic questions are invariably questions of external validity.  I highlight the intractable problem for EBM if the knowledge of the basic sciences is ignored.  The `subgroup' debate is introduced.  I return to this debate after discussing the statistical inference in EBM.

#Section 2: Statistical Inference in EBM

#Chapter 5: General Principles

 Chapter 2: Why Randomise; Chapter 3: Therapeutic Decisions and the Problem of External Validity; Chapter 4: Statistical inference in EBM: General Principles; Chapter 5: Statistical inference in EBM: Rofecoxib; Chapter 6: A Philosophical Framework for EBM (if you still want to call it that).  Progress report: I am about half way through Chapter 1.  Chapter 2 and 5 are pretty much done.  Chapter 4 I am looking forward to, and I think old versions of the rofecoxib paper will help.  Chapter 3 needs doing, and there is a chance it could turn into a monster.  Perhaps I will have to split it.
