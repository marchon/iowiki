[[[break]]]added at line 0: *lime {code - companies which currently produce morbidity would be incentivised to claim money to treat it
-- but that's not a problem, is it?
- companies would be incentivised to produce morbidity in anticipation of the scheme coming into effect
-- that IS a problem
- companies would be incentivised to misreport their outcomes
-- but presumably could be made to police each other
