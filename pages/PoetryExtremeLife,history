Potassium-Argon Dating is really useful for dating minerals and rocks of over 100,000 years old. However, I don't think this particular method of dating is limited to Geology. So there you go.

As a note, radiocarbon dating by the usual method can only date organisms to about 50000 years (The newer, more efficient, methods can reach 70000 years using a smaller sample), so they are not close to being useful for this. There are other dating methods that go much further back (some to several million years), but I don't know if there are any that can be applied to the organisms themselves. There might be some that can be applied to the ice though. However, these dating methods aren't always as good as they seem - especially those longer term ones - and typically have uncertainties of up to 10%. Because of this, things like analysing the content of air bubbles in the ice and comparing it to the atmosphere at the time might be just as useful. I don't know the specifics of the scenario though.

I apologise for not having the specific references for the above at the moment (I am remembering from high school Ancient History). I just thought that it was worthwhile noting.
