Hi All,
For those who might have missed the class on Wednesday, 21 February, I've got a pretty muffled recording you are welcome to listen to (with the volume on full, you can decipher most of it). Drop me an email and I'll send it to you.

Hi all,
I just finished reading the handout that Jason gave us in the last lecture and found it intriguing, enlightening and also quite alarming. I've started a topic for it here:

SexAndDeath.Backwards.Evolution?

Hi All,

I mentioned a recent New Scientist article (13 January 2007) on this subject in the last class. I'm scientifically naive, I admit, but to me the whole article seems to misinterpret evolution, and it disturbs me that an article like this has appeared in a "scientific" publication. Click on the above link if you want to read more. Of course, if you don't, don't.

I have a lot of half-formed and probably misguided ideas on this topic, and I suppose that I've been skirting around the issue in other discussions. Perhaps I can be enlightened here.

Hi All,
For those who might have missed the class on Wednesday, 21 February, I've got a pretty muffled recording you are welcome to listen to (with the volume on full, you can decipher most of it). Drop me an email and I'll send it to you.
Cheers

Hi all, 
I just finished reading the handout that Jason gave us in the last lecture and found it intriguing, enlightening and also quite alarming. I've started a topic for it here:

SexAndDeath.Backwards.Evolution?

Hi All,

I mentioned a recent New Scientist article (13 January 2007) on this subject in the last class. I'm scientifically naive, I admit, but to me the whole article seems to misinterpret evolution, and it disturbs me that an article like this has appeared in a "scientific" publication. Click on the above link if you want to read more. Of course, if you don't, don't.

Do you, like Dawkins, Williams and Maynard Smith believe that group selection doesn't occur?  Or like ..Wynne-Edwards, Wilson, and Sober do you maintain that group selection is both possible and a major influence on evolution?  Come have your say.
