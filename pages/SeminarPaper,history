-- For example, consider someone who doesn't have knowledge of the optical properties of water and perceives a 'bent' stick half submerged in the water.  If that person removes the stick from the water and discovers it to be straight should they judge their initial perceptual experience of the 'bent' stick to be ..non-veridical or should they judge themselves to have discovered a new aspect to the linkage "rules"?

[[[break]]]changed line 12 from: *orange {code - Is there a relationship between Fichte and Davidson in terms of the need for the existence of other rational beings in order to have consciousness? (Discussion moved to Fichte.and.Davidson 18/05/08.)


*blue Tom says ~
This is tantalising! Given how difficult it might be to bring up, coldblooded, as it were, in tute, would you care to elaborate here a bit more? My understanding of Fichte was that he is a subjective idealist: the absolute subject is its own self-positing, and it must posit its other in order to generate an consciousness of objects. How do other people fit into this system? And how are you thinking of Davidson in relation to Fichte?!*

*green Okay here's a brief ..run-down on what I understand Fichte's position to be:*
- *green Our (indefeasible) transcendental starting point is the I positing itself.*
-- *green The acceptance of this starting point is reliant upon one's acceptance of the categorical imperative, i.e. the recognition of oneself as a free moral agent.*
-- *green Thus freedom becomes an essential part of Fichte's system*
- *green Next, given our transcendental starting point we look for its necessary conditions.*
-- *green It is in this context that the necessity of others is posited.*
- *green From the above we need to be able to deal with a concept of freedom.  However, Fichte holds that the only kind of _actual_ freedom that can exist is limited or finite freedom.*
-- *green So now we are in situation in which a necessary condition for the existence of the ..self-positing I is some sort of limit on its freedom.*
- *green Next, Fichte notes that one can only be conscious of oneself as an individual and takes this to require that one also be aware of a realm of rational beings of which one is a member. (And a necessary condition for this is a world of objects.)*
- *green Finally then, it is the "summons" from what we take to be other free beings like us that provide us with the necessary limit on our freedom.*

*green Okay, so that's Fichte sorted (maybe).  Next I guess we need to look a little more at Davidson's idea of the necessity of an interpreter for consciousness (I might take a stab at this next week) and then see if any aspects of the two views match up.*  

*green Perhaps Fichte's central use of freedom and the desire for freedom of spontaneity in the sort of project Davidson is engaged in might be good early bridging candidates?*
}*[[[break]]]to: *green {code _Our knowledge of our perceptual environment_
- Lately I've been trying to get to grips with the idea that our knowledge of the how...there linking rules (i.e. the way in which our perceptions should change as we move through our environment) depends in some way upon our knowledge of perceptual reality
- I guess I'm little confused over the status of this additional perceptual "rule" content
-- a particular issue s that being able grasp what "rules" come bundled with any given perception seems to require that one has knowledge of the environment within which the perception occurs
--- does this then mean that our perception of reality is mind-dependent in the sense that our knowledge of additional perceptual "rule" content is dependent upon us having sufficient knowledge of the perceptual environment?


_Brain's in vats_
- Bruin's response to the brain in a vat problem seemed to be that we could be sure that we weren't a brain in a vat because we can check whether our supposed perceptions contained these sort of rules 
-- I don't think I really understand this response (hopefully I can get Bruin to run through it again on Tuesday)
-- is the argument that veridical and non-veridical perceptions are separated by whether or not their associated "rules" check out?
--- but couldn't someone who was worried about brains in vats or hallucinations respond that perhaps the new perceptions that occur in our testing procedure are just electrical stimulations/hallucinations too?
-- or perhaps the argument is that non-veridical perceptions do not have these associated rules?
--- this interpretation doesn't seem to fit with the bush mistaken for a person example however

*green _We have the idea of belief only from the role of belief in the interpretation of language, for as a private attitude it is not intelligible except as an adjustment to the public norm provided by language.  It follows that a creature must be a member of a speech community if it is to have the concept of belief.  And given the dependence of other attitudes on belief, we can say more generally that only a creature that can interpret speech can have a concept of thought._*

*green Somehow Davidson links having the concept of belief with actually be able to have beliefs (and other concepts).  However, as the authors of the article point out, "why the concept of a belief is needed to have other concepts is somewhat obscure in Davidson's writings."*

*green Based on the quote above, perhaps Davidson's argument that other people are necessary for consciousness has its roots in Wittgenstein's private language argument: language is needed in order for us to have concepts and a community is needed in order to have language.  As indicated above however, the first step along this path seems quite shaky.*

[[[break]]]deleted at line 22: *red {code _..McDowell's Problem with Davidson_

In the seminar last week Bruin mentioned that no-one seems to have a clear idea of what it actually is about Davidson's position that ..McDowell has a problem with.  I think I have at least some idea (although it seems a little obvious - but at least it will provide a starting point for further discussion/investigation).

..McDowell's objection to Davidson seems to hinge upon Rawls' description of his response to the "brain in a vat" thought experiment.  Apparently, Davidson was of the opinion that under his conception of the relation between mind and world, nothing would change is it turned out that we were just brains in vat being fed electrical impulses that simulate sense impressions of the external  world.  For McDowell this is unacceptable, he wants any account of the relation between mind and world to enable us to be sensitive to changes in the underlying nature of reality.

Perhaps an example might help me make my point clear: suppose that there is a mind independent reality that is just the way it seems to be (chairs exist independently of us and are "..chair-like", etc.).  Next, suppose that I go to sleep tonight and whilst asleep someone sedates me, removes my brain, places it in a vat and hooks me up to the exciting new "world-computer" which exactly replicates all the impressions I would have were I still in the "real" world.  Under Davidson's account this fundamental change in my account would not be noticeable to me.  It is this aspect of Davidson's account that is unacceptable to ..MccDowell - for him, we cannot be floating free of th nature of the world even in this minimal sense.

I think I have at least some idea (although it seems a little obvious - but at least it will provide a starting point for further discussion/investigation).

..McDowell's objection to Davidson seems to hinge upon Rawls' description of his response to the "brain in a vat" thought experiment.  Apparently, Davidson was of the opinion that under his conception of the relation between mind and world, nothing would change is it turned out that we were just brains in vat being fed electrical impulses that simulate sense impressions of the external  world.  For McDowell this is unacceptable, he wants any account of the relation between mind and world to enable us to be sensitive to changes in the underlying nature of reality.

Perhaps an example might help me make my point clear: suppose that there is a mind independent reality that is just the way it seems to be (chairs exist independently of us and are "..chair-like", etc.).  Next, suppose that I go to sleep tonight and whilst asleep someone sedates me, removes my brain, places it in a vat and hooks me up to the exciting new "world-computer" which exactly replicates all the impressions I would have were I still in the "real" world.  Under Davidson's account this fundamental change in my account would not be noticeable to me.  It is this aspect of Davidson's account that is unacceptable to ..MccDowell - for him, we cannot be floating free of th nature of the world even in this minimal sense.

McDowell is responding to the apparent conflict between the desire to have one's mental conceptions that are directed towards the world in some way responsive to that world and the desire to be free to construct these (and other) mental conceptions.  In order to elucidate this problem he uses the arguments of Davidson and S??? for the incompatibility of these concepts.

_The argument for incompatibility_

At this stage in my reading the reasons for the position is unclear but I think I have a fairly good grasp of the position itself.  S??? argues for a logical dichotomy between the logical space of reasons (in which normative attitudes of various kinds are constructed) and the logical space of nature (in which empirical descriptions in general and natural-science descriptions in particular are formed).  Because of this dichotomy one cannot construct the normative attitudes towards empirical experience necessary for one to direct one's mind at the world in a satisfactory way without committing the naturalistic fallacy (by trying to construct a normative account in the purely descriptive logical space of nature).

_McDowell's response_

I'm very unclear on the details of McDowell's response at present.  However, he purports to offer a solution in which the dichotomy presented above is maintained but one is still able to construct a normative account of the way one relates to nature.  This seems to hinge on what he terms "second nature", which in some way allows one to extract normative concepts from empirical experience.

*What's it all about then?*
Something to do with the meta-philosophical aspects of McDowell's Mind and World.  In particular I think  I'll be looking at the way in which it can be compared with Wittgenstein's meta-philosophy.  

Bruin was of the opinion that he has diverged significantly from Witt. both in his use of Rorty's concept of a "picture" and in his attempt to give an historical justification for his meta-philosophical position.
----
*Next Steps*
- Read through the parts of McDowell (including the later lecture series) in which he explicitly refers to his metaphilosophy.
- Read through some of Rorty's stuff (The Mirror of ature in particular) in order to get a feel for his "picture" concept.
