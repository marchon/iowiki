Poetry of the Universe, 2008
Dayal Wickramasinge and Jason Grossman

# handbook description
This course aims to provide a conceptual understanding of some of the many faces of the large-scale universe.

We will discuss general issues relating to the nature of mathematics and science, space and time, and the universe as a whole.

The main topics of the course are: the overall structure of the observable universe; space and time; relativity; black holes; phenomena and reality; anthropic principles; and extraterrestrial life.  Each topic will be introduced in a historical context emphasising how it has evolved over time and is still evolving.

600-word essay (week 7): 20%
600-word essay (week 12): 20%

# Lectures
1.1 Overview (DW)
2.1 Structure of the Universe (DW)
[Dayal: not sure whether I understand my notes here: it looks from my notes as if you _might_ have wanted to merge your overview lecture with the structure of the universe one, but I think probably I'm misreading it]
- can I add a lecture somewhere around here on understanding large numbers?  I can teach it if you like.  Jason
2.3 History of Astronomy I: The Music of the Spheres (DW)
2.4 History of Astronomy II: The Copernican Revolution (DW)
2.5 Methods of Science (JG) [I've moved this to later than it was, because I'd like to use what you've talked about in the history of astronomy as a case study: OK?]
3.1 Measurement of Spacetime; Real Numbers (JG)
3.2 Continuity and Motion (JG; or could be guest lecture on Zeno's paradoxes)
3.3 Absolute and Relative Space and Motion; Handedness of Space (JG)
4.1 Relativity Before Einstein (DW)
4.2 Curved Spaces (+ Light Cones) (DW)
4.3 Relativity According to Einstein (DW)
4.4 Motion in Spacetime: Paradoxes (JG)
4.5 Time and Change (JG)
5.1 The Arrow of Time (DW)
5.2 The Direction of Time (JG)
5.3 Causality (JG)
6.1 Toward the Big Bang (DW)
6.2 Black Holes (DW)
7.1 Phenomena and Reality I (JG)
8.1 Anthropic Principles and Multiverses (DW)
7.2 Phenomena and Reality II (JG)
9.1 Life in the Universe I: SETI and SETD (JG)
9.2 Life in the Universe II: weird life (JG)
9.3 Life in the Universe III: panspermia (DW)
