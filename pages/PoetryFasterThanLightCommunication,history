So the laws remain unchanged (always govern the stuff in the same ways) but the laws say ‘in some conditions, x is what happens to stuff’, AND they say (or imply and should say) ‘in other conditions, y is what happens to stuff’ or ‘x & y are what happen to stuff’ etc. I’m suggesting that, perhaps, we don’t rightly know what the laws say (imply or should say) about those ‘other conditions’, but if we did know, it may be that there is no inconsistency.

Then we just have to answer the big origin questions like: Did the laws always exist? If yes, do the laws necessarily have the values they do, or could other laws have obtained, and if so how – what governed the ‘decision’ of the laws? If no, what in the world (actually, what NOT in the world) made them come to be, and what governed that?

*purple Perhaps we don't need a super-law, and perhaps the current laws don't break-down close to a singularity - it may be that there is an aspect of the current laws (not immediately obvious) that we've failed to consider, which would only be relevant (have a discernible effect on observations or outcomes of though-experiments) in conditions like those close to a singularity. So I'm suggesting the possibility that the laws/thoeries we have are good (not obviously inconsistent), but incomplete and there is simply an aspect we have overlooked which explains why our intuitions about the speed of sound in a singularity seem inconsistent with our beliefs about relativity and the speed of light. 

It seems that this could easily occur:

It's like throwing a ball in the air. It changes speed, direction of movement etc, but all the changes are caused by one set of physics laws which never change, ever, during the whole thing. If the physics laws change after time has started like the movement of the ball, the movement can't be arbitrary, there has to be something governing it, i.e. a super-law (unchanging physics law in the ball example) which also has to pop into existence which requires another law for this to happen in, and forever it goes back ... ... u4309050*

To go along with Tegan's arguement and the idea that laws don't apply to a singularity...Im not sure if that is the case, but for the INITIAL SINGULARITY it may be safe to say that laws didn't exist...not saying that the laws haven't always existed in the universe's history...but that the singularity did. If indeed all the forces and all the dimensions were created during the big bang, then indeed time didn't exist before the big bang, and thus laws didn't exist before the big bang...but after the singularity exploded (i.e. the big bang), the universe existed, so then by logical conclusion, the singularity existed before the universe did, so perhaps the laws didn't apply to the initial singularity. 

As for the rod problem, I'm prity sure that on a relativity level, nothing can travel faster than the speed of light, not even information. Thus, it could be observed for say, a space ship of significant length (half a light year for arguements sake) that if you fired the engines at the back, by compression the front wouldn't move straight away, but would only move when the compression wave indeed reached the bow of the ship! But thats relativity. Now lets look at quantum scales. Two electrons existing in the same system by definition must have opposite spin, if one electron is on one side of our solar system and the other is on the other, then by relativity it's going to take them a long time to get a conversation started...yet by quantum mechanical models, if we alter the spin of one of the electrons to match the electron on the other side of the solar system, then simultaneously to that event, the other electron will alter its spin to be opposite...instantaneous information transmission!!! It gets into really deep physics to understand that further (and by deep I mean almost no one can properly explain what the hell is going on!) but if it is true...I can see why Planck and Einstein hated each other so much!!!!!

The speed of sound through a solid is definately related to the density of the material it is travelling through. I'll just pluck the speed of sound in a solid equation out of the physics textbook...v = sqrt(k/m)d

[[[break]]]added at line 0: *lime {code My friend and I were talking about the feasibility of faster than light communication, and I thought it would be good to see what the Poetry hive mind thinks. Read on!

Imagine a row of magic dominoes, each of which will fall over at the speed of light. When we tip over the first domino, the chain of collisions travels down the row.

Initially, there appears to be no problem. It's just like we sent a photon across the same distance. However, we actually arrive at the end faster than the photon. How much faster? When the last domino falls, we're ahead of the photon by a distance equal to sum of the width of all the dominoes.

So, the basic idea is that by banging objects against each other, _information is instantaneously from one end of an object to the other._ 

Now, you might think that any collision of object A traveling at speed S into object B will not result in object B moving at speed S, but at a fraction of S. That is, each domino will bleed off energy in each collision, slowing down the rate of communication. This may be true in some situations, but it definitely isn't for all of them. 

Behold, elastic collisions!
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_Collisions

Is _every_ perfectly elastic collision faster than light communication? If we have perfect, instantaneous kinetic energy transfer between two objects of equal mass, will information propagate instantaneously from one side of the object to another?
An example: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Elastischer_sto%C3%9F.gif

We see things that look like elastic collisions all the time. I happen to see them a lot on the pool table, when a player hits the cue ball into the eight ball with such force that the cue ball stops dead and the eight ball carries on. However, my intuition is that force of the cue ball actually ripples through the eight ball as its molecules bump into each other, starting at the impacted side and traveling to the opposite side. This force propagation might occur slower than the speed of light. 

My friend's riposte is to consider a situation with elementary particles. Objects with mass (and thus volume), but no internal components to bump into each other. Now we're in murky waters. For one, we don't know yet if there really -are- elementary particles. Even if there were, however, I think the particle/wave duality may come into play here. If a particle is also a wave, it may be possible to think of it as a spring. If we hit one end of this spring, the totality of the spring will not just leap forward, but squish and extend into a new position, taking time. This analogy, however, may not reflect reality.

So, thoughts? Has all this been answered before?
