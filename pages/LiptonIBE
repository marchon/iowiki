*What is it?*

A book detailing the context and details of inference to the best explanation.  Obviously arguments for and against the position are also discussed.

*Where can it be found?*

Lipton, P. (2004), Inference to the Best Explanation, 2nd Ed., Routledge.

*Where does it fit in?*

The indispensability argument is intimately related to IBE (although the exact relationship will require a little/argument).  Hence this book will provide some insight into a fundamental component of the argument.  My hope is to able to demonstrate that the mathematical context is sufficiently different from the general scientific as to make IBE unsatisfactory and/or that even assuming the applicability of IBE in this context, one cannot get an IBE argument going.
