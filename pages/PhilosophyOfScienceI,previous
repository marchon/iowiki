I'd like to briefly expand on what I just said in the tute regarding the importance of consciousness - specifically the importance of my consciousness.

I'll start with a caveat: I'm not religious and not advocating any kind of spirituality.

The main philosophical disagreement I have with my science-friends is that I approach the world by thinking "There is me, I observe things... etc". My science-friends approach the world by thinking "There is a world, I'm part of the world, I observe things..." In our discussions this sometimes leads to philosophical disputes, and when I explain my position I get blank stares from science-people and knowning-nods from the philosophically inclined. Much like in the tute today.

So what am I saying, and what does in mean for quantum physics?

Basically, I think. My thoughts and, within them, me experiences presuppose everything (even the grey matter that produces those thoughts). And that world exists as I experience, and if I don't experience it only exists to the extent that I experience results of it.

For quantum physics, I'm more than happy for the entire world to be 'uncollapsed' until the moment I observe it. I'm happy for all of the past to be uncollapsed. I'm happy for the results of your experiment to be uncollapsed until I learn about them. It's not just consciousness that can collapse systems, it's only MY consciousness that can do it. I think that my observation changes everything. For instance, I can't die because my observation requires me to be alive. (Where I to be dead, I couldn't be dead in any relevant sense because there would be no universe for me to be dead in)
