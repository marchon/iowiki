# Ongoing To Do List

* Get broad thesis outline on paper/wiki
* Find Berger and Selke paper and read it


# Ongoing vague questions and what I want to read to answer/clarify them

* What is the link between bayesianism and a fully worked out philosophy of science?  What, if anything, needs to be added to the bayesian framework for it to function as a 'complete' philosophy of science? How does methodology, confirmation theory etc all fit in with the bayesian framework?  ..Read: philosophy of science - Cartwright/Hacking etc.. Finish H&U.. Earman
* Will second-order probabilities cause any problems for practical use of bayesian methodologies? .. Berger
* What are the problems of the choice of test statistics?  Which are problems only for classical and which are problems for both classical and bayesian? ..H&U

## Weekly *Plan*

# w/b 18/9/06
* Read LANCET pre-publications on COX-2 inhibitors/diclofenac
* Intro to Steve --- ?inclusion LANCET and NEJM papers and other meta-analysis results

# w/b 7/8/06
* Start thinking about Paper 2 - Mayo
* Start sorting medical paper with simulations (with Steve)
* Rofecoxibpaper.and.H&U

# w/b 17/7/06
* Split rofecoxib paper into two
* Paper 1 - focus on rofecoxib as case study; talk only about classical statistics and the way in which APPROVe was interpreted in practice - pretty much paper as it is currently be remove focus on Mayo. Target "Studies in Hist and Phil of Biol and Biomedical Sciences". Complete ASAP.
* Paper 2 - look to provide a reply to Mayo 2006 using studies like APPROVe as examples which raise questions which Mayo does not seem to be considering, ?or at least providing a strange answer to - highly statistically significant findings from under -powered studies. Target Br J Phil Sci then move down the list.

# w/b 10/7/06
* wow, it has been a long time since i have done this
* complete cox-2 draft (seriously) and send of within 2 weeks
* talk to jason about upcomming rofexocib papers and correction in NEJM http://content.nejm.org/early_release/index.shtml#7-13-06  (?possible link with work melb people are doing)
** Yeah.  Isn't it amazing that they can say "visual inspection of Figure 2 suggested that the Kaplan-Meier curves separated 18 months after randomization. However, the results of an overall test of the proportional-hazards assumption for the entire 36-month observation period did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.07)."?  So whether two things (in the results, note, not in the population) differ depends on a significance test?!  (CC Alison on this point.)  Jason
* sort Sydney
* sort small paper with Steve on rofecoxib and decision risk with simulation data

# w/b 19/3/06
* continue with cox-2 paper
* send off finished jeffrey
* continue with Mayo, have a crack at Berger & Selke

# w/b 6/3/06
* start drafting cox-2 paper
* read mayo
* find woodward, lewis

# w/b 6/2/06
* Complete Jeffrey r/v draft
* Prepare rofecoxib presentation for popn health and pharmacy meeting
* Write abstract for NMS

# w/b 30/1/06
* Outline (at least) for the Jeffrey review.
* Start thinking about some abstracts (and talk to MC, JG re thoughts about possible 'medical' conferences - NMS , disease-mongering, ?pharmacoepi) see PresentationsAbstracts
* Continue with Mayo and Hacking
* Not sure I will get to it.. but.. new proposal outline

# w/b 23/1/06
* the continuing joys of Jeffrey. start writing r/v.
* look to get my head around the links between Jeffrey's expectation discussion and H and U test statistic chapter
* starting thinking through my claim that I can frame my key points on the rofecoxib story within a classical statistics framework

# w/b 16/1/06
* Jeffrey: I am particularly interested in attempting to get some understanding of exchangability.
* Still need to get back to test statistic stuff (some good overlap between H and U and Jeffrey here)
* Selections from the generic list above

# w/b 9/1/06
pretty much what is above... focussing on:
* another couple of Jeffrey Chapters
* Reply to "Why do we need large simple RCTs"
* Test statistic stuff from [=HandU=]

# w/b 3/1/06 
(this is becoming a list of things I am procrastinating on - but i definately need to get the following done, if not this week then soon [see http://www-csli.stanford.edu/~john/procrastination.html -- Jason]:)
