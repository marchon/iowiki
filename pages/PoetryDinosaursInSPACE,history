*black The interesting thing to note about the awesome picture above (it's from the _Dino Riders_ TV series, if anyone didn't recognise it) is that the carnivorous dinosaurs (and the pterodactyls) needed the evil, tyrannical Rulons to place mind control devices on their heads to make them attack, while the herbivorous dinosaurs attacked happily without force.  It's nice that Tyco was teaching kids the message early on that it's always fine for the good guys to use any and all weaponry at its disposal.

*red Its ok. The Pteradon wasn’t actually a dinosaur at all and so, despite its herbivorosity (totally a word), it could plausibly defect. Check out http://www.creationmuseum.org/ if you need any more information on dinosaurs. That is, if you really need a comprehensive and reliable source. I think I have a photo from one of their exhibits at home, but I’m typing this at work (because I’m naughty) so you will have to wait with bated breath...

Considering the difficulty in creating blue lasers (they only became commercially available in the last year or so and are prohibitively expensive) we could conclude that carnivorous dinosaurs were of superior intellect or at least achieved greater scientific advancement. I'm not sure whether the colour would play a part in the millitary applications but I'd be comfortable in concluding that this factor would be a good indications that it was the carnivores (and flying cowards) who won the war. Unless of course, the war depicted was in fact a civil war between herbivores, and the T-Rex joined in in alliance with the pteradons.. Oh my. The plot thickens.
