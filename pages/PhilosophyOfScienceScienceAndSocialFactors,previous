The combination of the lecture today (on what makes a planet), and the lectures last week (evidence based medicine and the Hierarchy of Evidence) has got me thinking about science, and the people influencing science.  Should these be separated in the study of the philosophy of science?  

To expand on the examples; the discussion in the lecture about how Pluto was demoted from being a planet brought out several social factors, such as the definition of a planet was made by a majority vote (and allegedly with a stacked branch), and that one of the main objectors to this new definition has a vested interest in that he is in charge of a space mission to Pluto that might lose status if not actually lose funding.  Even if the above is a simplification, it shows a human dimension to scientific arguments.  I took note of Jason’s observation that the more you look at the history of science, the more you see the social influences (my apology if I have misquoted you here Jason. *fawn no, that's exactly right -- Jason*)

I had similar thoughts about possible social influences in the development of the Hierarchy of Evidence.  I could imagine legal considerations could be a consideration.  For instance, maybe Level 1 evidence is easier to defend in the courts if later experiments show the tested drug actually acts differently than originally tested.  I also wondered about the role of big drug companies – maybe an agreed hierarchy means they could limit their own testing (and their funding of other bodies) to clinical, randomised, controlled trials, knowing anything else could be devalued if not actually discredited.  Both of the above is merely speculation, but in my belief it is unlikely that governments would adopt a methodology without some level of consultation/negotiation with stakeholders (including drug companies and lawyers.)  So is this science, or is it a corrupted version? 

While the above could be read as examples of humans interfering with the purity of science, and should not belong in the study of the philosophy of science, I am leaning to the opposite view.  I could be persuaded that science only exists because humans choose to pursue it, so without the human element there is no science.  As a consequence, studying the philosophy of science must include the human dimension.  

As further support for considering science and social influences together, I think of how science over the years has been shaped by the social structures around it – religion being one example.  Maybe a modern example is the politics around the science of climate change.   

There are probably well-established concepts in philosophy that relate to this, with wonderfully philosophical words to use in casual conversation.  I hope to equip myself with them during the semester so I can say the above far more concisely, even if it is only understood among philosophers.

*fawn I like all of that.  But suppose just for the sake of argument that science shouldn't include social factors, and that (contrary to what you say) science would exist even if humans didn't pursue it.  PHILOSOPHY of science would still include social factors, because we haven't got any way to understand science except by seeing how it actually works, and how it actually works is very much influenced by social factors, as the case studies show.

*pink I don't understand how an argument that “science would exist even if humans didn't pursue it” could ever be put forward convincingly.  Science is a way of constructing knowledge, a way of constructing reality.  Absolutist scientists seem to believe that some universal ‘true’ reality exists, independent of the taint of our cognitive processes, and perceptions.  Science is trying to discover some ultimate, divine truth; free of subjectivity, a reality that is independent of humans.  

But what is the point when reality IS socially constructed?  No one interprets or categorises the world without attaching social meaning.  Everyone views the world through a different lens, resulting from past experience.  Each person is subjective, creates artificial categories (eg stereotypes, schemas) etc in order to understand and navigate the world they occupy.  Social and cultural meaning is attached to everything.  It is an unavoidable trait of humanity.  The eternal striving towards a science that is free of subjectivity/ independent of the social context may be impossible depending whether you subscribe to scientific realism or not (better? sorry).  The belief that this is achieved through adherence to the experimental method seems hopeful. As WI Thomas said “What people believe to be real will be real in its consequences”.  The meaning we attach to our world and the consequences of the meaning is what’s important because it is what influences/predicts our behaviour.  (and this sort of comes back to the Biology as ideology/Medicalisation argument, is the scientific way of constructing knowledge adhered to by medicine causing us to treat disease at an individual level, thus obscuring the social forces behind disease?)

I suppose I am wondering whether the symbolic interactionist perspective of sociology can be applied to science.   “Symbolic interactionism sees people as actively constructing their world.  Humans are seen as active, creative participants who construct their social world, rather than passive, conforming objects of socialisation.  The emphasis is on interaction and social processes as dynamic and changing.  Symbolic interactionism focuses on the process of interaction in the formation of meaning for individuals.” (paraphrased from http://web.grinnell.edu/courses/soc/s00/soc111-01/IntroTheories/Symbolic.html)  Eg.  Scientists negotiate the meaning by publishing their articles in journals and then arguing about their results.  This is a social process.  Or maybe I am just brainwashed into interpreting everything from a sociological perspective because it's my major. :)

*fawn Sociology is very cool.  If we had time, we'd do a lot of sociology of science.*

*fawn You might just want to edit what you've written to change words like ``inane''.*

*fawn Jason*

wrong word to use? 

*fawn You wouldn't want someone to call your view inane.  You can afford to use a milder word: people will still get the message that you think it's wrong.  Jason*

*pink I wrote a long reply but it got deleted somehow (blessing in disguise) so in dotpoint

- I was definitely too extreme / black and white above, sorry (i was in a bad mood)
*fawn 
-- Definitely no need to apologise!  If you want you can edit what you wrote earlier. Jason

- Now that I have read the chapter in Ladyman on Scientific Realism I understand the whole debate much better

- In particular the primary/secondary properties distinction is fascinating, especially since it allows the Scientific realist notion of a mind-independent reality, while acknowledging the way we often make 'errors' in our perceptions, and the way our cognitive representations of reality are limited (eg the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis)… in fact you could say my view of reality (above) was limited by having done a psychology degree /sociology degree, haha.

*fawn Good points.  Thanks.

I like the ..Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis.  There's a linguist who has a dog named Benjamin Lee Woof (after Benjamin Lee Whorf), but I can't remember who.
