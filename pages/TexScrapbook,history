[[[break]]]added at line 0: *lime {code # Fred Blogs Jr in BibTex

From http://nwalsh.com/tex/texhelp/bibtx-23.html:

"Juniors" pose a special problem. Most people having "Jr." in their name precede it with a comma. Such a name should be entered as follows:

"Ford, Jr., Henry"

However, a few people do not use a comma. They are handled by considering the "Jr." to be part of the last Last token:

"{Steele Jr.}, Guy L." "Guy L. {Steele Jr.}"

This name has no Jr part.
