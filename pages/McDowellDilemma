For ..McDowell, when we consider the relation of mind and world in the context in which it has been approached in the past, we are drawn into an oscillation between the Myth of the Given (which doesn't allow for freedom of spontaneity and offers exculpations for our intentional mental content instead of something normative) and Davidsonian coherentism (which leaves our spontaneity "spinning in a frictionless void" out of contact with the world).

At this stage is probably a good idea to develop clear accounts of the two positions we are oscillating between:

Myth.of.the.Given

Davidsonian.Coherentism

..McDowell hopes to overcome this oscillation by undermining a presupposition common to both of the views.
