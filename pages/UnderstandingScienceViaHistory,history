[[[break]]]added at line 0: *lime {code I think it's good if all science is understood via the history, but I don't think I can do a very good job of explaining why I think that.  I'm still working out for myself exactly why I think that.  It's something to do with the fact that we keep assuming that some historical debate or other finished ages ago when in fact we're still in the middle of it.  Or to put what I THINK is the same point in a different way, doing the history gives us lists of things which scientists are currently assuming because people in the past won debates by force of character and only temporarily; those are assumptions which we shouldn't take too seriously, both because they're probably wrong and because they'll probably be opened up again for re-examination in the future.
