In order to turn a PhD into an academic job, you need:
- luck
- money (or borrowing capacity)
- a strong ego

Of course, a PhD doesn't need to convert to an *academic* job --- there are other paths to travel, depending on your other qualities.

On the other hand, for some jobs a PhD is actually of negative value.
