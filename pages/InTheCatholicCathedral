The cathedral knew about guilt.
Many have suffered, it said.
Will you care for yourself above Christ?
Have no guilt while He dies on the cross?

Mary knelt and wept.
She knew it was true she'd heard it before.
She offered a candle to the dead.

But Joy danced high upon the altar.
Beneath the stained glass windows
She yawned and sneezed and sang.
Jesus had remorse for Man
A billion feel his fear
But even his hymns
-->even his Latin
-->even his crucifix
can't stop Joy
-->dancing in the aisle
-->dancing on the desk
-->dancing on the tarmac
can't stop Joy.
