-> i) "reason" - an explanation provides a reason to believe that a phenomenon occurs
-- Runs into problem regarding ..self-evidencing explanations (i.e. where A explains B and B gives evidence for A): if explanation is the provision of reason(s), then self-evidencing explanations are circular.

-> ii) "familiarity" - two versions: 
- 1. An explanation connects unfamilar phenomena with ones that are already familiar.
-- Prob. re: how do we get "bedrock" familiar phenomena?
-- Prob. re: how exactly does this "connection" work?
- 2. Unfamiliar => a tension with other beliefs, explanation removes this tension.
-- Does not fit the situation in which we want to explain something that is already familiar.
-- Prob re: explanations that involve other unfamiliar things.

-> iii) "..deductive-nomological" - explain by deducing phenomena from premises including at least one necessary law.
-- Prob re: scientific practice often fails to do this.
-- Prob. re: doesn't account for explanatory asymmetry.
-- Prob. re: inheritance of disjuntive inclusion and logical equivalence problems from the ..hypothetico-deductive inference model

[[[break]]]added at line 3: *lime {code Similarly to the problems associated with inductive inference in the previous chapter, we again run into issues to do with justification and description of our explanations.
}*[[[break]]]added at line 4: *lime {code _Justification_
- Very difficult to give objective criteria via which the quality of an explanation can be assessed.
- However, we certainly don't face a sort of infinite regress of why questions (in which our explanations are themselves in need of explanation and so on) as often one level is enough to provide a satisfactory explanation.
-- e.g. crop failure can be explained by drought without drought also needing to be explained.

_Description_
}*[[[break]]]changed line 8 from: *orange {code 

}*[[[break]]]to: *green {code - Lipton makes a good point against Bandu's argument in this chapter: "the issue is not whether the explanation is true, but whether the truth really explains". p22
- Is explanation our first step in hypothesis formulation?  And hence, the why-regress desire arises out of a need to put the potential hypothesis on a more rigorous footing (or at least to connect with other elements of our belief system).
