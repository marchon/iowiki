Having read all that, if you still want to make a walled garden, you can do it by making what I call a *project*.  To keep a project about (say) wombats separate from the rest of the wiki, name its pages wombat!cuddling, wombat!vicious, etc.  This has two advantages:

- Pages that are part of such a project don't need to have dots or ..CamelCase in their names.  

- The administrator of your web server can give each project a different page template (colours etc.).
