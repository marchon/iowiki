For van Fraassen, the anti-realist's attitude to explanation differs in that he or she is willing to accept that the fact that data fit particular theories, is just that - a fact.  It does not have, nor does it require, some form of explanation.

[[[break]]]added at line 22: *lime {code _The Demand for Explanation_
Arguments for realism that involve explanatory power as a criterion for theory choice only work if the demand for explanation is all-pervasive.  This demand leads to the need for some theory (or group of theories) at least to be view as "real" so that they can provide a sort of "bed rock" for explanation of other theories that one may want to adopt in an instrumental way.

*van Fraassen's Views*

_Sellars' Argument for Inferential Quality as Grounds for Realism_
Two statements:
-> 1."As I see it, to have good reason for holding a theory is ipso facto to have good reason for holding that the entities postulated by the theory exist."
-> 2. "We are always willing to believe that the theory which best explains the evidence, is empirically adequate."
-> The first, by Sellars, is an attempt to link IBE (as a commonly employed scientific technique) with a realist position.  The second, by van Fraassen, is an attempt to show that explanatory basis for scientific inference can be employed without the need to adopt a realist attitude towards scientific theories.

*What do I think?*

- Mostly that I'm confused at this stage.  More reading is needed...
