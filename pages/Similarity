*The Basic Idea*

Similarity seems like it is almost the most fundamental of concepts we have, it would be interesting to try to look at cases of where and how it manifests.

*Initial Avenues of Investigation*
- It seems unlikely that we can make sense of the world without similarity.  In this sense it manifests in relation to considerations regarding the unity of consciousness (although I think the "problem" of unity is actual a pseudo-problem brought about but a failure to adopt the correct "subject-first" viewpoint that must be our starting point for philosophy.
- Is it our ability to wield the concept of  similarity that makes it possible for us to wield all other concepts?  That is, do all of our other concepts rely on a similarity relation, be it directly, or by virtue of their ability to be reduce to combinations of other concepts that do?
- Nietzsche has some stuff on the origin of similarity.  For him, our ability to call things the same, when they are not taken in all particulars, while obviously illogical has played a crucial role in our ability to survive as a species and is fundamental to the development of our capacity for reason.
