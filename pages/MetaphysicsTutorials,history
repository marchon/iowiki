Hi Chris,

I think I'm in the same tutorial as you.

Perhaps you could think about the problem of good v. evil in the context of torture. Is the torture of one person good if it yields information that saves many lives? I was going to raise the issue today, but we ran out of time.

I've also made a brief posting on the mathematical realism wiki. Hope that you don't mind the intrusion.

}*[[[break]]]to: *green {code - Could one respond to the problem of evil by simply stating that we lack the perspective to see that what is an apparently evil act is in fact a good one?
-- e.g. Murder is in fact a release from the vale of sorrows for the murdered and a prime motivator for serious introspection and a gain in self-knowledge of the muderer and those who knew both parties.
-- This amounts to questioning the premise "evil exists" by means of questioning whether or not we really know what evil is.

- are the qualities attributed to God really maximisable as is required by the ontological argument?
-- e.g. is power maximisable?
