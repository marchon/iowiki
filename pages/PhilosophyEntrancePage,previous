The philosophy program in the School of Humanities is a generalist program with seven permanent staff and several visiting staff.  The program covers all the main areas of Western philosophy [link to description aimed at undergraduates ... by the way, should maybe add links to Wikipedia to that].

The philosophy program teaches a varied undergraduate program [link], including an honours stream [link], a postgraduate program [link], and has an active research program with a weekly seminar program [link].


# What’s on in Philosophy?

In addition to the formal teaching programmes, there is a wealth of philosophical activity at ANU, in which honours students and postgraduates are welcome to participate.  The Philosophy Program in the School of Humanities has a weekly seminar during the teaching period, and honours and post-graduate students are encouraged to attend (Friday mornings 11-1) [ADD LINK].  In addition, CAPPE has a weekly seminar [link to http://www.cappe.edu.au/forthcoming-events.htm], and Philosophy RSSS has two seminar series – a main seminar at 4.00 on Thursdays [link to http://philrsss.anu.edu.au/events/seminars.php], and ‘philsoc’ at 4.00 on Tuesdays [link to http://philrsss.anu.edu.au/events/philsoc.php].  Finally, the Social and Political Theory program in RSSS has a lunchtime seminar on a regular basis, usually on Mondays [link to http://philrsss.anu.edu.au/events/spt.php].  Other seminars of interest may be offered in Political Science, School of Social Sciences, Faculty of Arts, Political Science in the Research School of the Social Sciences, in the Research School of the Humanities and, indeed, at other locations in ANU.

# Centres of Philosophy at the ANU

Because there is such a lot going on in philosophy at ANU it may be helpful to know a little about its various parts. 

The ANU is broadly divided into two parts. In the Faculties the focus is both on research and on undergraduate and graduate teaching. In the Institute of Advanced Studies the focus is on research and graduate teaching. The School of Humanities (Faculties) RSSS and CAPPE (Advanced Studies) are all places where philosophy is going on within the College of Arts and Social Sciences (CASS).

Undergraduate teaching of Philosophy is located in the School of Humanities within the Faculty of Arts and offers a rich programme of study through to Honours level. For more information about undergraduate study here, including the current courses we offer, click here [ADD LINK]. 

The School of Humanities Philosophy programme also offers post-graduate students excellent supervision in a broad range of philosophical traditions, and first-rate facilities. Each full-time student has a room and all are provided with a computer with access to word-processing, printing, internet and email facilities. If you choose to do your graduate work with us, you will also become part of a strong and exciting community of researchers.  Some of our current and past research students have commented on the experience of doing philosophy in the School of Humanities [link to philosophy-postgraduate-testimonials.doc].

The ANU is a partner in the Centre for Applied Philosophy and Public Ethics, an Australian Research Council funded Special Research Centre. This Centre is devoted to research, providing policy input and promoting community discussion and professional dialogue in ethics. Its research programs span Criminal Justice Ethics, Business and Professional Ethics, Ethical Issues in Biolechnology, IT and Nanotechnology: Ethics of Emergent Technology, Ethical Issues in Political Violence and State Sovereignty and Welfare Ethics. 

You can also pursue graduate studies in the Philosophy Program in the Research School of Social Sciences (RSSS), which is part of the Institute of Advanced Studies. The Philosophy Program is primarily a research department, working mainly in the analytic tradition, and only takes students at graduate level. 
Philosophers can be found working in other parts of the ANU as well, for instance in the Automated Reasoning Project, which stages the annual Logic Summer School [link to http://lss.rsise.anu.edu.au/]; in the Social and Political Theory Program; in the jurisprudence section of the Faculty of Law; and in the Humanities Research Centre. Many of these academics are affiliated with the ANU Graduate Program in Philosophy, which is convened jointly by Philosophy in the School of Humanities, CAPPE and the RSSS Philosophy Program.
