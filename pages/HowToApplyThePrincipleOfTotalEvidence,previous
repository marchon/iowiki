How to Apply the Principle of Total Evidence

The answer is the likelihood principle.

``A principle which seems generally recognized,[footnote 10: Keynes, op. cit.[J.~M.~Keynes, {\it A Treatise on Probability\/} (1921)], \p.313, refers to `Bernoulli's maxim, that in reckoning a probability, we must take into account all the information which we have'.] although not always obeyed, says that if we wish to apply such a theorem of the theory of probability to a given knowledge situation, then we have to take as evidence $e$ the {\it total evidence\/} available to the person in question at the time in question, that is to say, his total knowledge of the results of his observations.'' \cite[p\p.138--139]{Carnap:1947}

``Bernoulli's maxim,[footnote 1: {\it Ars Conjectandi}, \p.215: `Non sufficit expendere unum alterumve argumentum, sed conquirenda sunt omnia, quae in cognitionem nostram venire possunt, atque ullo modo ad probationem rei facere videntur.'] that in reckoning a probability we must take into account all the information which we have'' \cite[\p.313]{Keynes:1921}
