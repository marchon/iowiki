[[[break]]]changed line 9 from: *orange {code This is a valid point (in my eyes) although I think the suggestion was to take a better look at what we have so we can fathom what forms earth life can take, then take this knowledge and apply it to the SETI (or SETD - whichever you prefer).  We dont have to focus all of our attention on earth life - just spend a little more time investigating it while continuing our extra-terrestrial endeavours.

[[[break]]]added at line 0: *lime {code Today in my tutorial Hamish suggested that before astrobiologists  look into space for non-earth like life a more extensive study should be carried out looking at all life on Earth, especially in the oceans as there is so much there that we know nothing about. The idea was that this would give the astrobiologists a clearer picture as to what non-earth like life would 'look' like.

My thoughts are that this is a good idea but I am not sure if there would be a clear point at which they could stop looking at Earth life and instead look into space. Doesn't life keep on evolving on earth? Would it be possible to ever discover all life?

I don't think we ever could have complete knowledge of all life on Earth in fact I look at the whole topic in a similar fashion to the way I view this course. In this course we have looked at a wide range of topics never spending too long on one topic, so instead of spending a whole course looking at Copernicus (I don't want to offend any Copernicus fans here, it may well be fun to just look at him) we have looked at a multitude of topics. We know that we could never know all there is to know about Copernicus and his revolution so we can look at him briefly and get a general idea for what he was about. Likewise we can look at Earth life but then we need to move on and look elsewhere, as if we make it our mission to understand Earth life before we look into space we will never stop looking at Earth.
