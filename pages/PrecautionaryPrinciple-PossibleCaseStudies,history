They could repair bad spots in valves. The problem is hat if they were too intelligent, the host could be in danger :)'' (ElaineOran)

[[[break]]]added at line 0: *lime {code We need a conceptual link between the case studies, or at least reasons for picking the case studies we do.   E.g., one where the PP works really well (clinical trials); one where whether it works depends on technological developments (nanotech?); one where whether it works depends on metaphysical or abstract issues (animals).

We'll need to at least mention standard environmental ethics cases.  Whether we can have a case study on that might depend on whether we have room on the project team for an enviro expert.  If not, can use an environmental nanotechnology case study.

}*[[[break]]]changed line 3 from: *orange {code - I guess we want a more standard environmental ethics case too
- maybe a nanoethics case
- maybe animal consciousness (Bradshaw 1998, which I haven't read yet); could interest Singer etc.
