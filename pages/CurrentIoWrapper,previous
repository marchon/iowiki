The wrapper is here: http://dendik.bpa.nu/io/iowiki-wrapper/wrapper.io

Or via git: {code git clone http://dendik.bpa.nu/io/iowiki-wrapper/.git}

To use with standalone version, follow the specified  configuration procedures in IoWiki's readme, then put wrapper.io into IoWiki's working directory and run it (the wrapper.io).

To use with CGI version, follow the same configuration instructions (at the moment there is no configuration docs or examples in IoWiki so it's a bit of problem here:), then put wrapper.io in the directory. You may need to create a small shellscript wrapper to setup paths or may it be that renaming wrapper.io to something.cgi will suffice.

*blue It has one major limitation yet: all the sleep is CPU-active, so you always have 100% CPU load while running this code.*

*green I'm sure there's a way around that, but I can't remember what it is.  Let's ask on the list.  Jason*

*blue No need. :) I figured it out: Server does it all. PS, Jason, please put docs & config sample into the distro if you have them. (PPS. feel free to remove this conversation once you've read it). -- DanyaAlexeyevsky*

*green There are no docs except what's in the code and on this wiki --- sorry! :-(  You shouldn't need any config info except what's already there, and maybe a file called ..LocalConfig.io --- see below.  If you need anything else, there's something wrong --- probably my fault, but I wonder what. .Jason*

*blue It's really weird: the previous time I unpacked the tarball and run CGI, I got an exception that Defaults.io could not be found, and I created an empty one and copied configs from previous version to make it all work... However I extracted now the very same tarball and Defaults.io is there! Sorry for false alarm then. The docs in the code (in the configuration file) plus installation instructions and syntax on the web suffice for me: what else does one ever need to know about wiki? -- DanyaAlexeyevsky*

*pink Hooray!  Now I should merge all your changes into the main code.  Or you're welcome to do it.  I'm a bit swamped with my main job at the moment, plus moving house, plus shearing alpacas.  Anyway, you're my hero!  Jason*
