*Missing features*
- page names should be able to have apostrophes in them
- if a page has no contents OR if its contents are merely whitespace, it should show the ... ahem ... ``haiku''
- maybe the recent changes page should show the current server date and time

*Long-term bugs*
- When pages are edited using the lynx browser, nasty characters get inserted.
- I need to refactor (reorganise) the code in various places.
- Space characters in URLs don't get parsed properly even when they're encoded, thus: file:///Users/jason/Desktop/Blatch/memory tax invoice.pdf.  I guess I'm going to have to allow square brackets around URLs, even though I don't need them for anything else.
- Emailing changes is broken.  Don't know whether I really want to fix that.

*Minor bugs to be fixed soon*
- The following link doesn't work but misleadingly looks as though it will: Philosophy.of.Science.This.might.be.useful.if.you.don't.have.the.textbook
- instructions are wrong: imply that character set is small when in fact it's all of unicode (except for what a browser can't show)
- *code* at the beginning of a page seems to have stopped working --- see passwordless.ssh
- RSS feeds could include a (customisable) number of chars of each updated page.
- The RSS mechanism needs to be documented in AdministratorDocumentation.
- Hot links with full stops immediately after them are AProbLem.  I think I almost have this fixed.  I think they only fail now when they're *crimson embedded InCoLourEtc.* ... and here: consistent with the data.''  And From InterpretationOfConfidenceIntervals: .  Bugger.
- notification should only send out pages changed since last notification ... or I might just drop notification
- if a page's contents are deleted on an edit, the edit does nothing :-(
- The page history must use colours which ordinary pages can't use.
- page names with a slash should be rejected _before_ editing's allowed; and maybe the same goes for other characters?  Namely:  ";" | "/" | "?" | ":" | "@" | "&" | "=" | "+" |
                    "$" | ",".
- a problem with italics:
_testing italics_

_ testing italics _

_Necessary Background_


_Traditional Philosophy_


_Wittgenstein's Approach_

- colour closing problem:
*pink urgent: 
-this
-that *

this line shouldn't be pink
