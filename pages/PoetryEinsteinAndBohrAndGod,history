_Einstein liked inventing phrases such as "God does not play dice," "The Lord is subtle but not malicious." On one occasion Bohr answered, "Einstein, stop telling God what to do."_

_At the sixth Solvay Conference, in 1930, Einstein thought he had found a counterexample to the uncertainty principle. "It was quite a shock for Bohr... he did not see the solution at once. During the whole evening he was extremely unhappy, going from one to the other and trying to persuade them that it couldn't be true, that it would be the end of physics if Einstein were right: but he couldn't produce any refutation. I shall never forget the vision of the two antagonists leaving the club: Einstein a tall majestic figure, walking quietly, with a somewhat ironical smile, and Bohr trotting near him, very exited... The next morning came Bohr's triumph._  (Rosenfeld 1968, p232.)

_I am studying your great works and - when I get stuck anywhere - now have the pleasure of seeing your friendly young face before me smiling and explaining._ (Einstein Letter May 2, 1920, after meeting Bohr.)

_Whether our actual meetings have been of short or long duration, they have always left a deep and lasting impression on my mind, and when writing this report I have, so-to-say, been arguing with Einstein all the time even when entering on topics apparently far removed from the special problems under debate at our meetings._ (Neils Bohr, from Albert Einstein: Philosopher-Scientist (1949), publ. Cambridge University Press, 1949.)
