Few people realise that psychologists also take a vow, promising that at some point in their professional lives they will publish a book, a chapter or at least an article that contains the sentence: `The human being is the only animal that...'. ... it is with good reason that most psychologists put off completing The Sentence for as long as they can, hoping that if they wait long enough, they might just die in time to avoid being publicly humiliated by a monkey.

My talk in Kyoto University was on ``philosophical techniques'', and the first one I discussed was the use of the definite article, ``the''. My host Yasuo politely pointed out to me that Japanese doesn't have a definite article. No matter---unfazed, I moved on to another technique, which involved the subjunctive conditional. ``Professor Hájek: Japanese does not have that either.''

`Do you know how I got this beard?' asked the Biscuit.
`Grew it, I suppose.'
`Not at all. Far from it. Very much otherwise. It's a long story and reflects a good deal of discredit on some of the parties concerned. When I was a baby, you must know, I was a beautiful little girl. But one day my nurse took me out in my perambulator and stopped to talk to a soldier, as nurses will, and when her back was turned a wicked gypsy sneaked out of the bushes, carrying in her arms an ugly little boy with a beard. And do you know what she did? She stole me out of my perambulator and put that ugly little boy with a beard in my place. And ever since then I've been an ugly little boy with a beard.'

There are seven windows in the head, two nostrils, two ears, two eyes and a mouth; so in the heavens there are two favourable stars, two unpropitious, two luminaries, and Mercury alone undecided and indifferent. From which and many other similar phenomena of nature such as the seven metals, etc., which it were tedious to enumerate, we gather that the number of planets is necessarily seven. Moreover, the satellites [which Galileo claimed to have seen around Jupiter] are invisible to the naked eye and therefore can have no influence on the earth and therefore would be useless and therefore do not exist.

It will take hundreds of years to abolish war, and there will be a ``fiery roll of martyrdom'', opening with these recusant convicts of Tolstoi's.  It is these people, who will become an ever increasing number all over Europe, who will finally shame the peoples of Europe into viewing war and international hatred as you do, instead of viewing it as they do now.  Great changes are generally effected in this way, but by a double process---gradual change in the general sentiment and practice, led and really inspired by the extreme opinion and action of people condemned by the mass of mankind, whom nevertheless they affect.
