Is there a difference?  What is it? 

Is eliminative induction simply a precursor to a more detailed experimentalist position?

H&U (if i remember rightly) present eliminative induction and then reject it as an argument for randomisation.

JW has argued that at the some aspects of Urbach's argument regarding randomisation relies on eliminative induction.
