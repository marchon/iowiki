# Fred Blogs Jr in BibTex

From http://nwalsh.com/tex/texhelp/bibtx-23.html:

"Juniors" pose a special problem. Most people having "Jr." in their name precede it with a comma. Such a name should be entered as follows:

"Ford, Jr., Henry"

However, a few people do not use a comma. They are handled by considering the "Jr." to be part of the last Last token:

"{Steele Jr.}, Guy L." "Guy L. {Steele Jr.}"

This name has no Jr part.

``Ragged-right setting is initiated by restricting the spaces between words to have a fixed width, and by putting variable space at the right of each line. You should not call \raggedright until your text font has already been specified; it is assumed that the ragged-right material will not be in a variety of different sizes.  (If this assumption is not valid, a different approach should be used: \fontdimen parameters 3 and 4 of the fonts you will be using should be set to zero, by saying,
e.g., `\fontdimen3\tenrm=0pt'. These parameters specify the stretchability and shrinkability of interword spaces.)'' --- from the TeXbook
