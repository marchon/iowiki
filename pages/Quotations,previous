Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, `Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented and fabulous?' Actually, who are you not to be? Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are born to make manifest the glory that is within us. It is not just in some of us; it's in everyone. As we let our light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our fear, our presence automatically liberates others.

philosophy ... is not an activity `after' science, in a logical sense.  In particular, it does not rely on inferences from what best current science says about reality.  On the contrary, it is itself a kind of formal finishing school for scientific theory.  Its own products _are_ best current science.

You have your life and your work, and you should get the two as confused and mixed up as possible.  Make it all one fabric.  Vincent van Gogh did that.  Hank Williams did it, Allen Ginsberg, Bukowski, those kinds of people. ... Anne Frank, of necessity, did it.

The ethical incoherence of our customary treatment of nonhumans has been demonstrated time and again by Singer, Regan, Sapontzis, {DeGrazia}, Pluhar, and others. Almost every member of the American Philosophical Association would agree that all mammals are conscious, and that all conscious experience is of _some_ moral significance. But somehow this has no connection with one's choice of food. Like the undergraduate who listens to, and actually understands, the refutation of naive relativism, and still writes in the final exam that ``no one can judge another person's morality,'' many philosophers suffer from a sort of inferential paralysis.

Imagine how many physics students came to Caltech because of Richard Feynman. Undoubtedly they could have had some interesting interactions with him while they were here. But undergraduates would have found that he taught graduate seminars almost exclusively, while graduates would have found that he almost never took on any Ph.D. students. Too much worry and responsibility --- he wouldn’t feel right giving a student a problem that he hadn’t already solved himself. While to me this seems like a scandalous abdication of duty (where would he have been if John Wheeler and others at Princeton had felt the same way?), the motivation is perfectly understandable.

Few people realise that psychologists also take a vow, promising that at some point in their professional lives they will publish a book, a chapter or at least an article that contains the sentence: `The human being is the only animal that...'. ... it is with good reason that most psychologists put off completing The Sentence for as long as they can, hoping that if they wait long enough, they might just die in time to avoid being publicly humiliated by a monkey.

For many years, working in a medical research institute, I noted that few citations in published papers were from more than five years before this paper was written.

`Grew it, I suppose.'
`Not at all. Far from it. Very much otherwise. It's a long story and reflects a good deal of discredit on some of the parties concerned. When I was a baby, you must know, I was a beautiful little girl. But one day my nurse took me out in my perambulator and stopped to talk to a soldier, as nurses will, and when her back was turned a wicked gypsy sneaked out of the bushes, carrying in her arms an ugly little boy with a beard. And do you know what she did? She stole me out of my perambulator and put that ugly little boy with a beard in my place. And ever since then I've been an ugly little boy with a beard.'
