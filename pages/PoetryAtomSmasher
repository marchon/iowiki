The Large Hadron Collider could discover extra dimensions and invisible matter. On top of this some believe that when it is turned on for the first time  that it will create a black hole that will orbit the Earth. Thing is we won't know if a Black Hole has been created for several years as apparently it will be too small to detect until it is too late.

*red The possibility of twilight zone stuff happenning is trivially remote though. I was far more excited about the Super Monkey Collider anyway. Who cares about the god particle.
