# The debate

*Initial Matters*
- Realism := a,b,c, etc. exist and the fact that they exist and have the properties they do (..F-ness, etc.) is independent of beliefs, linguistic practices, conceptual schemes, etc.
- Hence 2 methods of attack: ~existence or ~independence.
- Can deal with sentences involving objects under investigation due to disquotational properties of ..truth-predicate
-- i.e. 'Fa' is T iff a is F
- need to split off issues to do with how to account for similarity (i.e. stuff about universals, etc.)
