[[[break]]]added at line 4: *lime {code - *blue I meant entropic time.  A ball which is already moving can keep its momentum as it travels into a time-reversed space.  But something which lives in that time-reversed space has its natural tendency to go (from our point of view) from a more ordered state to  a less ordered state.  Jason*

[[[break]]]added at line 0: *lime {code I don’t see how a part of the universe could have time going in the opposite direction to the rest of the universe. How would objects or light travel over the border? That section would be at a different stage of history to where the rest of the universe is. The space would be undergoing a different phase of time. I can imagine a baseballer throwing a ball up in the air, about to hit it. If the part of space in front of him were going in the other direction, as he throws his ball up, about to hit it, the ball comes shooting back at him (he would have hit it at the end of the clip).

Maybe this isn’t what Jason meant, but if it isn’t please tell me!

And another point,

If the arrow of time has to be pointing in the same direction across all of space, and we won’t be able to tell if it wiggles around and goes backward, forward, sideways like a drunk driver; what does it matter at all, asking what the arrow of time is? We are firmly centred inside the universe and will never be able to look at it from outside. So how can we possibly hope to understand anything about what time is like from outside the universe? Surely, asking the questions is as senseless as asking, “Has the universe just increased by 10,000%?”, since we could never hope to notice any difference if it had.
