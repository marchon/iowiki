fried onions
mustard seeds?
cumin seeds?
garam masala
cinnamon stick
dal
water
etc.


*Green mango dal*

Boil red lentils with grated ginger, turmeric, green chilli and a chopped green mango. (The small cooking mangoes are best. Peel the mango, and cut what you can of the flesh off the stone, but cook the stone in with the dal, too. You can get the rest of the flesh off when it is cooked.)

Mush everything up nicely before serving, salt to taste, and add a little fresh lemon juice, chopped fresh coriander, and/or garam marsala, just before serving.
