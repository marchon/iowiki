[[[break]]]added at line 44: *lime {code - While on the face of it mathematical realism seems to be the position that is most compatible with a sort of "common sense" view of mathematics, upon further examination I'm not so sure that this is case.  When you actually think about them, actually existing abstract mathematical entities (indeed, any sort of abstract entity) are very strange things indeed.  Thus, I don't think the realist can really claim any support from some compatibility with the "common view".

_Problem Responses_
- Epist.:
-> Godel: as empirical data are to concrete object  knowledge, math. intuition is to math object knowledge
-- prob. re: giving a clear account of math. intuition
-> Frege: knowledge of math objects is just knowledge of propositions involving math objects.
- Hence just need to explain justification for these propositions.
-- prob re: is this position actually Platonist (i.e. should knowledge of suitable propositions count as knowledge of the objects they contain)?

*What is it?*

The view that the truths of mathematics are thus independent of human activities, i.e., they are objective.

*Realism and Platonism*
_Platonism_
Platonism is a form of math. realism in which the existence of independent math. objects is posited.  Thus reasoning involving maths is exactly the same as reasoning involving concrete objects.
_Problems for the Platonist_
- _Epistemological:_ If math objects are abstract, how do we come to have knowledge of them?
- _Practical:_ how do these abstract mathematical objects (or even truths in the general realist case) relate to the practices that we have for determining mathematical truths (i.e. proof procedures)?
