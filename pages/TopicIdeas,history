Ethics and epistemology of complementary medicine.  This could be a large topic.  One part of it that seems essential, but does not appear to be well treated in the ad hoc things I have read, is a version of the demarcation problem in science.  Which complementary medicines are based on science; which are not; and how do we draw the line.  Importantly, this is prior to the ethical questions; an view is needed before the ethics can be discussed usefully.

formal consensus methods in deciding whether clinical trials have `equipoise' (ok there's a bunch of problems with equipoise' but that just makes it more interesting).  maybe.  this is just an application project, and maybe it has already been done, but if it hasn't there is a small project there. maybe.
