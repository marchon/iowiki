do you *really* want this page editable?
I mean people could edit it. Just like I just did.. :P (except more destructively)

Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. :D

Wikis store every edit in a database and are revertable. So if someone did vandalise the page, 'twould be but the work of a moment for Jason to restore it to a previous version.

*vandalises*

That's right: I can get rid of vandalism very easily. So I don't mind vandalism happening. Jason
