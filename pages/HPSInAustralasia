We [Jack: who is we?] are trying to make a list of people who work in HPS in Australasia.

If you're in Australasia and you work on the history and/or philosophy and/or sociology of science, medicine or technology, please put your name and affiliation below.  You do this by choosing "Edit Page" from the menu on the right.

If you'd like to receive emails on events in HPS please subscribe to the Galileo email list by visiting http://luddite.cst.usyd.edu.au/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/galileo.

Thank you.
