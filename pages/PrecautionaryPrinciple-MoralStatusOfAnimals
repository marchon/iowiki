Bradshaw (1998) has proposed that an application of the Precautionary Principle tells us that we should accord a high moral status to many non-human animals (henceforward called simply ``animals'').  His argument runs as follows.  ``A vast number of animals depend on us for their survival and ..welfare.''  (Bradshaw 1998 p.1)  We cannot tell for sure whether they are conscious or not.  We believe that other humans are conscious, but many of us believe that no non-human animal is conscious.  However, if we are wrong about that then the consequences are dreadful.  By the precautionary principle, we should (arguably) act now in the way we would if they were conscious ends in themselves.

We propose to greatly clarify this argument.  One type of clarification will be conceptual: for example, Bradshaw runs the argument in terms of consciousness, but consciousness is a red herring.  The argument can be run directly in terms of the moral status of animals, without needing to debate consciousness, thus:

- animals may have high moral status
- if they do then the moral consequences of some of our current actions are dreadful
-- assumption: --> a precautionary principle, to be spelled out
-- assumption: some form of consequentialism, also to be spelled out
- conclusion: we should desist from at least some of our current actions towards animals

Beyond this conceptual clarification, we can make progress on Bradshaw's argument in more substantial ways.  In particular, it is impossible to apply Bradshaw's argument to ALL animals (including for example plankton).  According to some versions of Bradshaw's theory it would be desirable to do so, but according to other more common-sense versions of his theory we can apply the Precautionary Principle to some concrete yet vague group of higher animals.  Perhaps counterintuitively, the notion of a vague group can be made precise [CITE WIDELY].  We propose to develop just such a precise version of Bradshaw's theory, in a number of variants, and to see whether any of the variants stand up to stringent criticism.

"I've actually thought quite a bit about some of those arguments, and I'm half-convinced by them", he replied. "So I don't eat meat for lunch."'' (from Lipton quotes)
