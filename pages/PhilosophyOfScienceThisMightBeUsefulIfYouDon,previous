If like me you haven't managed to get a copy of the textbook you may find this useful.

Google has a copy of the entire book available on Google Books for you to read. There doesn't seem to be any easy way to print it off, so its probably not a replacement for the real thing, but it should help in the mean time.

The link is:

Incidentally, if you are sick of hassling the co-op bookshop to get copies in, I found the book on a internet bookshop for about $52 with free delivery. I only ordered mine the other day so I haven't got it yet, but I have ordered from them before and they are pretty good.

Hope this helps.

Also, I've photocopied Chapter 1 but forgot to bring it to the tutorials.  I can give it to the couple of you who still haven't got books at Tuesday's lecture.
