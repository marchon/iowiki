}*[[[break]]]changed line 5 from: *orange {code *Topic*
During the twentieth century there has been much debate over whether existence should be regarding as a predicate or as a quantifier.  I believe that the predicate view is correct but only in a trivial way - the predicate exists can be unpacked so as to remove all reference to existence and thus leave one with less controversial/problematic concepts.  Furthermore, much confusion has arisen from the fact that the existence predicate is often not "packed" the same way.
