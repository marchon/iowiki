*fawn We're thinking about changing the name of the course for next year.

What are your suggestions?

Suggest anything you like, but we're most likely to go for something relatively straightforward and descriptive.  If you're not sure what the course is about yet (which is fair enough --- we're only half-way through), look at Poetry-Syllabus.

^ everyone has read the hitchhiker's guide, so they would get the joke, smile and be more likely to enroll in the class. Good sales idea.

*pink When you suggested that (MATH1042/PHIL2042) I thought it was very unlikely to get through the bureaucracy.  But I tried it anyway ... and I think I've got away with it.  Thanks for the idea :-)  And hooray for the Head of Maths, Steve Roberts!  It's still got to be signed off by the College Executive, but it probably will be.
