Yeah you are right ... it wasn't the journalist, it was the actual scientist. How could he not understand the word 'paradigm'? You expect a scientist to know what he's talking about....u4309050

I think people enjoy using big words - perhaps when reading popular science, the public enjoy reading big words they think they understand, because it makes them feel smart. So journalists use them. (if you feel good while reading a magazine, perhaps you'll buy it again) And people don't really understand exactly what a paradigm is, but almost all have heard it (probably in business jargon) and have a vague idea of what it is, so it is an excellent big word to use in popular science type things. Before this course I had only seen it in Dilbert cartoons....u4309050

Title: Cosmic Flock. The solar system is filled with NASA's busy ships - and they're having a very good year
- Dan Cray

...'All three missions have thrilled and surprised scientists - who pride themselves on knowing more or less what to expect. "I sit back with my mouth open, watching paradigms shift," says Linda Spilker, Cassini's deputy project scientist'

My questions - how many paradigms have, in fact, shifted? How do we define a paradigm shift in an obscure field that we do not know anything about? What qualifies as a paradigm shift? 

The biggest paradigm shifts that we recognise, such as the overhaul of Newtonian mechanics with quantum mechanics, have involved a change in the fundamental questions that you are allowed to ask within the paradigm. Is it a paradigm shift, or simply a scientific advance, when new insights allow you to answer the original questions in a different way? Should a paradigm shift be confined to the scientific community in which it was defined?

Any thoughts?

p.s. - how do you 'watch paradigm shifts', and does this require a gaping mouth?? Interesting journalism...*
