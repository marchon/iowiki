This is off on a tangent but it something I'd wondered about and, what with all the space buffs in this course I thought it might be an interesting read.

talks about Sunshine's portrayal of people going it alone (without spacesuits) through space for a short time. I hadnt thought about the blood boiling, though its a logical conclusion when you think that lower temperatures are required at higher altitudes to bring things to boil (pressure cookers and autoclaves[sterilising equipment] work by going the other way).

They also linked to a case study from NASA, naturally, which goes into a little more detail
