[[[break]]]added at line 129: *lime {code *green Just quickly jotting down some thoughts I had in the library today (10/7) regarding a possible (partial) approach.*

Approach:
- lets allow ..IBE-based sci. realism
- lets allow indispensability-based math. realism to work in much the same way
- even if we do this, it is by no means clear that what we get out can accurately be termed Platonism

What's needed:
- clear sketch of how ..IBE-based sci. realism works and how this links in with indispensability
-- possibly also need to look at how they might not be linked (if space)
- clear portrayal of the sort of "mathematical" entity resultant from indispensability
- clear portrayal of mathematical entities involved in "classical" Platonism
- analysis of the differences as to their importance
-- in particular, what is involved in the notion of an "abstract" entity?

*green Some notes on considerations arising from rereading the "what is a mathematical object?" section of Forster's Axioms of Set Theory.*
- 2 considerations:
-- transparency of identity
--- does the link with particular theories at least muddy the waters here for the objects resultant from indispensability?
-- the empty widget
--- if we don't have confirmational holism for mathematics (i.e. if we don't get the whole system from one scientific application), how do we get an empty widget from indispensability?
--- this one will probably cost too much in shoe leather though
- also, how uncontroversial are the above notions?
(certainly transparency of ID seems like the one of the most uncontroversial things one could say about math. entities)

-- if one examines scientific practice, does one find that mathematical investigations (by this I mean investigation into the properties of mathematical objects inolved in scientific theories) play a role?
-- if so, then the practice of mathematics is inextricably intertwined with the practice of science
-- the practice of mathematics involves proofs and if the antecedent above holds, this part of mathematical practice is scientific practice too
-- how (and why) then, does one distinguish between proofs (and the entities involved therein) undertaken in a scientific context and those undertaken in a mathematical one?

*Thesis Outline*

_Introduction_
- *green contextual clarity (hopefully) goes here*

- context:
-- realism debate
-- scientific realism

- potential motivating examples:
-- fermat's last theorem
--- interesting because it has changed status (within the mathematical community at least) recently
-- brownian motion
--- good solid applied example with heavy reliance on mathematics that I'm reasonably familiar with (measure theory)
--- does it really feature in our *best* scientific theories though?

_The Indispensibility Argument for Mathematical Realism_

- indispensibility arguments in general

- mathematical entities
-- objects vs statements
-- *green aren't there two types of stuff we're interested in here - the properties of objects and the relations that objects stand in?*

- what is for a mathematical entity to be indispensible?

- the Quinean backdrop
-- naturalism
--- the descriptive thesis
--- the normative thesis
-- the ontological thesis
-- confirmational holism

- what are our *best* scientific theories?

- which dimensions of realism does Colyvan's position involve?
-- existence dimension?
--- of the set of properties of mathematical objects, which, if any, does Colyvan hold to exist independently?
--- can this set of properties be broken up in some interesting way?
--- 
-- independence dimension?
--- semantic realism
--- width of cosmological role

_The Consequences of Indispensibility_

- assuming the truth of the premises and just seeing what happens
-- (really need to work out some sort of normative framework to situate this descriptive stuff within)

- overdescription of mathematical objects
-- e.g. competing set theories

- what status do proofs have?

- what about idealisations/simplifications?

- do we end up with two classes of mathematical entities and/are relations?
-- i.e. those that enjoy use in our best scientific theories and those that do not

_Questioning the Foundations_

- confirmational holism:
-- Maddy: (some) scientific practice doesn't reflect this belief
--- criticism re: type of naturalism this is reliant upon
-- Sober: contrastive empiricism
--- Colyvan's reaction
--- my assessment
-- how close can we get to indispensibility without confirmational holism?  is this close enough for mathematical realism? (Colyvan ch. 2)

- naturalism:
-- Price criticism: no semantic ladder
-- Yablo criticism: no metaphor/literal distinction
-- naturalisms other than Quinean
--- do they carry ontological commitments in the context of mathematics?

- indispensibility
-- Field: mathematical entities are not indispensible
-- Colyvan's reaction
-- my assessment

_The Relationship of IBE and Indispensibility_

- IBE-based scientific realism
- does IBE entail indispensibility?
- does indispensibility entail IBE?

- Colyvan as attempting to use commensurability with scientific realist as foundation for his argument?
-- i.e. taking what the IBE-based scientific realist assumes to be the case and then attempting to show that this entails a commitment to indispensibility re: mathematical entities
--- maybe "entails" is a bit strong... 

_Conclusion_
- *green profundity (hopefully) goes here*
