Physicists who believe the Copenhagen interpretation of QM resolve
the apparent absurdity of a macroscropic object by endowing the
Geiger counter with consciousness. David Griffiths, whom I addressed
as "Prof. Reed" in an e-mail, because I found his e-mail address at
the Reed University website (he addressed me in his reply as "Mr Canberra") *fawn LOL (Jason)*,
states this (in "Introduction to Quantum Mechanics, at p. 431):

"There is something absurd about the very idea of a _macroscopic_ object being in a linear combination of two
palpably different states. ... How are we to reconcile this with
the orthodox interpretation of quantum mechanics?

"The most widely accepted answer is that the triggering of the
Geiger counter constitutes the "measurement", in the sense of the
statistical [i.e. Copenhagen] interpretation, not the intervention
of the human observer. It is the essence of a measurement that some
_macroscopic_ system is affected (the Geiger counter, in this
instance). The measurement occurs at the moment when the microscopic
system (described by the laws of classical mechanics) interacts with
the macroscopic system (described by the laws of classical
mechanics) in such a way as to leave a permanent record."

He then admits that the macroscopic world is made up of lots of
microscopic particles, which are each governed by a wave equation.
I'll come back later because I have to go out running.
