}*[[[break]]]changed line 34 from: *orange {code 3.    re lecture 10/8.   I thought it had shaken me out of my relativist tree; I think I'm trying to climb back.  My (?created) memories of it: relativism has no stable point for inter-society or inter-personal, or even intra-personal comparison.  ("In fact nobody agrees even with themselves")
Surely this requires too strict a definition of the strength and pervasiveness of an ethical view.  Eg we don't usually eat our dead.  There may be some people in our society who want to & some who do (these groups need not be subsets of each other).  But we have a conception of ourselves as non-dead-eaters, which is reenforced by law, and by personal taste (presumably largely culturally derived).  I cannot imagine any framing effect (if I have the terminology right - the order of information affecting the decision) about someone being dead that inadvertently gets me to say I'd like to eat him.  This should be strong enough for a comparison with - different time, different place - the Indian tribe Callatiae that Blackburn mentions.

The lecture left me feeling we were trying to get rid of relativism by diluting it with relativism.
Chris

-> I think the important thing about the Callatiae story is that while the Greeks and the Indians did things very differently, they _did_ share common ethical ground; they both believed in the respectful disposal of dead bodies.  So the moral is a bit deeper than "don't judge other cultures"; it's "don't judge other cultures until you know why they do what they do". *purple -D*


I accept what you say, but with a proviso.  But first - the lecture seemed to me to be an attempt to undermine relativism rather than show a better alternative & it is this undermining that I wanted to question.
If we want to be drawn out of relativism by a better offer then your point is valid, but my proviso: by coming up with a point like respecting the dead we are just trying to define the group we are talking about.  This probably has some validity because humans are what we are predominantly interested in & we can find a point like respecting the dead that applies to most.  We'll have to come up with a different group definition if we find a group of humans we want to include in our ethical considerations who have no thoughts at all concerning their dead.  And if we ever find non-human rational ETs this approach to relativism may not take us very far at all.  Chris

->I think the better alternatives come later.  Remember where we're at in Blackburn; he's discussing "Threats to Ethics", and relativism, particularly the "well, that's just your opinion" variety, is one such threat. *purple -D*

->*green Yeah, I promise some better alternatives will come later.  Maybe not RIGHT, maybe not even nearly right, but certainly better.  Jason*

1.  I was reading my son a story last night & realised I was describing the ethics course:

Brer Rabbit wanted to know where he was going.
Brer Turtle thought that was an interesting question, 'cause he hadn't thought about it.  Going was so much of a problem that where he went wasn't important.  Chances were he wasn't gon' get there anyway.  As far as he was concerned, he was going to wherever he got to.

2.   Is there something oxymoronic about a URL with 'luddite' in it?  A luddite with mob. phone & web page?  What is the role of a luddite in C21?
