I have been struggling with the concept of Falsificationism for weeks (and have been too distracted with study to write anything about it until now!)

I feel the main reason I struggle with the concept of Falsificationism is because I view science as quite the opposite. It seems to be drilled into my head that scientists develop a hypothesis about some phenomenon or another, and then set out to test it. They produce results that either confirm or disconfirm their theory; hoping, of course, to find data which confirms their hypothesis. If I understand Falsificationism correctly, scientists would set out only to find data that disconfirms their hypothesis, rendering all work on their theory useless and a waste of time. Now, why would someone who has spend years (and money) developing a model or theory about one phenomenon proceed to spend more time trying to prove the development wrong by falsifying it? (Unless one scientist develops the theory and yet another is 'responsible' for finding data which goes against it?) This just does not make sense to me! I don't recall Jason telling us the general reaction from scientists to the idea of falsificationism...

I have been able to accept or understand most of the other topics we have covered in the course (although some I feel need to be taken with a grain of salt) but I just cannot seem to see the value of Falisificationism. Is anyone able to convince me otherwise?
