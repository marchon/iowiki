YOYOYOYOooo How's it going guys?? I found some of these absolutely spot on translations of language that i'm used to seeing in that dry and unpalatable body of prose that is the scientific literature. I found them on Athel Beckwith's door (yes the same beckwith that discovered the dowd-beckwith ring expansion - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dowd-Beckwith_ring_expansion_reaction )

I hope they help liven up your journal searches as much as they have mine. 


It has long been known = i haven't bothered to check for references

It is known = i believe 

It is believed = i think 

It is generally believed = my collegues agree with me 

There has been some discussion = nobody agrees with me

It can be shown = take my word for it 

It is proven = it agrees with something mathematical 

Of great theoretical importance = i find it interesting 

Of great practical importance = this justifies my employment 

Some samples were chosen for study = the others didn't make sense 

Typical results are shown = the best results are shown 

Correct within order of magnitude =  wrong 

The values were obtained empirically = the values were obtained by accident 

The results are inconclusive = the results seem to disprove my hypothesis 

Additional work is required = someone else can work out the details 

The investigations proved rewarding = my grant has been renewed 

Synthesised according to standard protocols = purchased online from the aldrich chemical catalogue. 

If you're interested the catalogue can be found here http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/Area_of_Interest/Asia__Pacific_Rim/Australia.html

Peace out, Lorenzo.
