Response to Jeff/ General response to paper

The logical limit on how far to step back when considering causes of disease is which level of analysis will be the most powerful (and feasible when translated into action) when trying to eradicate disease.  It is important to remember that arguing about which causes are relevant is only important because of the consequences of this knowledge.  

The medical model/biological perspective describes disease as purely biological, and emphasises the individual.  Therefore treatment involves the individual being given drugs/ and the administration of other medical technologies.  Sociologists argue that this obscures the fact that disease is distributed unevenly throughout society.  From the sociological level of analysis, disease is caused by belonging to certain socio-economic groups, being of a certain gender, etc (in other words inequality).  From this perspective, manipulation of social structure and processes changes the prevalence of disease.  Anyone who has completed "Sociology of Health and Illness" with Kevin White will be familiar with this sociological argument.  White argues for "the transformation of social structures as the solution to the social, political and economic causes of patterns of disease." (http://www.contemporarynurse.com/13.1/13-1p5.htm).  
 
So why does the medical model remain entrenched?  One of the reasons is that subscription to the medical model of disease allows the status quo to be maintained, we don't have to question inequality or take responsibility for it.  Eg.  Diabetes is much higher in the Aboriginal population.  Why?  Because of poor nutrition etc.   Why?  Because of their low socio-economic status.  Why? Because of inequality in Australia.  It is much easier to stop at a micro level of analysis, rather than addressing society's broader problems.

[[[break]]]added at line 0: *lime {code I have just a few statements to make regarding this reading and Jason's use of it in class. However, these statements are a little loaded, so I want to give some disclaimers.

Sorry that my disclaimers are longer than my actual comments. I just don't want anyone to think I'm writing this because I'm a belligerent asshat. On to my comments:

When I finished reading "Causes and Their Effects," the first thing I thought to myself was "Wow. That was...political." Without any knowledge about the rest of the book from which this reading comes, it seemed like the writer was very keen on promoting particular health care and political concepts, and was largely using the notion of multiple causes as a tool to that end. 

The concept that causation occurs on multiple levels, in multiple ways, from multiple angles, is a fairly simple (and old) idea. Introducing its basic elements with the aid of two or three examples would take a page at maximum. We did it in class in a few minutes. Lewontin also didn't take too terribly long in explaining the concept, which was perfectly fine. The problem I saw was when this notion was used to make prescriptive statements regarding situations that warrant more complex discussion. In particular, I am referring to the last segment of the reading, starting on page 45:

"Asbestos fibers and pesticides are the agents of disease and disability, but it is illusory to suppose that if we eliminate these particular irritants that the disease will go away, for other similar irritants will take their place. So long as efficiency... remain[s] the motivating forces or productive enterprises the world over, so long as people are trapped by economic need or state regulation into production and consumption of certain things, then one pollutant will replace another... Asbestos and cotton lint fibers are not the causes of cancer. They are the agents of social causes... [I]n the end it is only through changes in those social forces that we can get to the root of problems of health."

Now, I've cherrypicked the hell out of this segment of text, but that was to identify key statements that I find erroneous without reproducing twice as many sentences with half of them bolded. Leaving aside the author's assumption that there will always be more irritants (which I find about as true as saying there will always be more trees), it seems Lewontin has made the same mistake in identifying causes as the doctors and biologists he is chastising. Doctors allegedly claim that a bacterium, virus, prion, etc. is the "cause" of a disease. Lewontin claims that the social structure is the cause of a disease. Yes, Lewontin has taken a step back and considered an additional element which has a significant role in making people sick. But there's no logical limit on how far to step back, or in what direction. To use his own language, our social structure is  the agent of humanity's biology, history, and environment. These, in turn, are all agents of the cause of our particular solar system's formation and placement. All elements in the universe, in fact, are agents of the first cause, which at the moment appears to be the Big Bang. Additionally, we could go into other causal territory. As Lewontin alludes to (though I can't find him explicitly stating it), getting sick is caused not only by being exposed to a particular substance or organism, but also by being susceptible to it. I would characterize Lewontin's basic suggestion as to decrease our susceptibility by increasing our quality of life in general, through food, hygiene, etc. However, our susceptibility is not only caused by our environment and lifestyle, but also by our organs, our genes, our immune systems, etc. 

Lewontin (and myself) may believe that for the purposes of keeping people from getting sick, a whole slew of these factors are too complex and large to meddle with. But that doesn't mean they're not real causes, and for a paper that criticizes others for being too narrow, the author should recognize that. Additionally, as I mentioned above, Lewontin describes the situation without acknowledging other elements of causation. The particular element I'm considering, which I brought up yesterday, is that some causes are necessary, and some are not. For many diseases, doctors are quite right that if you don't get the bug, you can't get the disease. As such, the bug is a necessary cause. It doesn't matter if you're living in Australia, America, Sudan, or the moon. It doesn't matter if you're a pauper or a prime minister. If you can't get the bug, you can't get the disease. There are many different ways to ensuring one doesn't get the bug, but the bug is necessary. The same is true for susceptibility to the bug, which again is the route I think Lewontin (and Jason) were primarily concerned with. This very well may be the more achievable method to decreasing population disease rates, but that argument needs to be made. When the focus of the discussion is on the nature of causes and how people are misinterpreting them, we need to not have our blinders on.

Bullet points of things I think weren't discussed enough 
• First cause
• Proximate and ultimate causes, and how there is a continuum of them. 
• Sufficient and necessary causes
• The multitude of causes out there

I guarantee I wrote something inarticulately, illogically, or ignorantly, so call me out! :-)
