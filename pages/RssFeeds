You can get an RSS feed for recent changes to this site at http://feed43.com/xeny-net-recent-changes.xml.

You can get a feed for my (Jason's) mini-blog at http://feed43.com/tumblelog.xml.

Both feeds update every 6 hours. If you want to know what's going on on the site more frequently than that, use the RecentChanges page, which updates immediately whenever there's a change. (Well, _almost_ whenever there's a change. There are bugs.)

In case you don't know, an RSS feed is an address you give to an RSS reader to let it keep you up to date with changes to a web page or web site. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rss for more details. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_feed_aggregators for a list of programs that can read RSS feeds.

BUT ... These RSS feeds are not working properly yet :-(

I will fix them eventually, but to fix them I may have to write an RSS server myself, in which case the addresses will change.  Jason
