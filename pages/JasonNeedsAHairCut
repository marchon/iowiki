This was left on the discussion board for the University of Queensland course "Philosophy of Mind" in 2006.
----

No-one has written it yet.
You are its poet.

I am the poet
This is the page
Empty, blank, silent
An actorless stage.

Hair is a concept
Mental yet real
Can you cut ideas,
Change their feel?

But feelings are elusive,
A chemical cocktail
Both delusive and compulsive
Irrational, my jail...

But am I fettered?
If there is no I to be freed?
Am I any better
With no jail to perceive?

Split a log
Split an atom
Cut your hair
Probe my mind.

No less a log,
No less an atom
No less a lecturer
No less I.

Signed, someone in PHIL2050.
