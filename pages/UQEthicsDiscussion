If anyone feels like discussing anything about the course, you can use this page, anonymously or nonymously.

*I'M VERY PLEASED THAT PEOPLE ARE USING THIS, BUT  IT'S STARTING TO GET A BIT HARD TO READ THROUGH THE PAGE.  COULD PEOPLE PLEASE START MAKING ..SUB-PAGES FOR SPECIFIC TOPICS AND CONVERSATIONS?  THANKS.  JASON*

->I've cut out the relativism discussion and put it on a new page, is that okay? *purple -D*

->*green Yes, that's perfect.  Other people please follow this example.  If you want to.  Jason*

You can make new pages to talk about specific topics.  To do that, edit in the phrase "UQEthics" followed by a dot followed by whatever you want the new page to be called --- e.g., UQEthics.Jason.needs.a.hair.cut.  When you save your edit, the phrase will automatically be turned into a link to the new page.

Hello World
dlorW olleH

I am talking to you through the new steam-powered internet.  Hooray. :)

You couldn't have told us the Rachels book was optional one day sooner, could you Jason?  Oh well, I'm sure it will be a worthwhile read. *purple -D* *green Yeah: I still think it's a really good book. Jason*

ps. Why can't I edit Jason Needs A Hair Cut?
*green You can.  I think.  Maybe the server was broken when you tried.  It crashes a lot.  Jason*
-> Ah, I was fooled by the lack of an "edit page" link - the page was editable straight away, because it didn't exist yet. :) *purple -D* *green Aha! And after you'd been so clever and worked out how to do purple text.*

How about a real topic now? I was thinking about .UQEthics.Animals in the car the other day. *purple -D*

1.  I was reading my son a story last night & realised I was describing the ethics course:

Brer Rabbit wanted to know where he was going.
Brer Turtle thought that was an interesting question, 'cause he hadn't thought about it.  Going was so much of a problem that where he went wasn't important.  Chances were he wasn't gon' get there anyway.  As far as he was concerned, he was going to wherever he got to.

2.   Is there something oxymoronic about a URL with 'luddite' in it?  A luddite with mob. phone & web page?  What is the role of a luddite in C21?

I'm going to make a page for stories - case studies if you will - which pose ethical questions: .UQEthics.Story
