*What is it?*

The view that the truths of mathematics are thus independent of human activities, i.e., they are objective.

*Realism and Platonism*

_Platonism_
Platonism is a form of math. realism in which the existence of independent math. objects is posited.  Thus reasoning involving maths is exactly the same as reasoning involving concrete objects and both are held to exist independently of our thoughts regarding them.

_Problems for the Platonist_
- _Epistemological:_ If math objects are abstract, how do we come to have knowledge of them?
- _Practical:_ how do these abstract mathematical objects (or even truths in the general realist case) relate to the practices that we have for determining mathematical truths (i.e. proof procedures)?

_Problem Responses_
- Epist.:
-> Godel: as empirical data are to concrete object  knowledge, math. intuition is to math object knowledge
-- prob. re: giving a clear account of math. intuition
-> Frege: knowledge of math objects is just knowledge of propositions involving math objects.
- Hence just need to explain justification for these propositions.
-- prob re: is this position actually Platonist (i.e. should knowledge of suitable propositions count as knowledge of the objects they contain)?


_Arguments for Platonism_
- Colyvan.Indispensability

_Non-Platonist Realism_
Talking about objects in math is just a convenient way of speaking.  Maths is really about general features of some less controversial/abstract kind of thing (e.g. collections, measurements, structures, etc.).
- e.g. structuralism - math. statements about collections of entities with similar structural properties or these abstract structures themselves.
- Problems:
-- structuralism still postulates the existence of abstract objects, just a different kind.
-- *green There is a point in Routledge concerning the need to phrase things in terms of possibility  (in order for things to be true in a finite world?) that I don't really get.*
