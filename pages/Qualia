Some people say qualia are just brain states and hence are philosophically unproblematic.

We can use this sort of move to get rid of other problems in philosophy.  For example: self-contradictory propositions such as the extended liar paradox (_This proposition is either false or meaningless_) seem to be problematic.  But self-contradictory propositions are just goldfish.  Goldfish are philosophically unproblematic.  So self-contradictory propositions are philosophically unproblematic.

Objection: qualia seem to be physically coextensive with brain states.  Self-contradictory propositions are not physically coextensive with goldfish.  OK.  Try again.  Self-contradictory propositions are just the numerical identity of 1 and 1, with which they actually are coextensive (since both are either everywhere or nowhere).  The numerical identity of 1 and 1 is philosophically unproblematic.  So self-contradictory propositions are philosophically unproblematic.  There.
