[[[break]]]added at line 0: *lime {code Recipe by ..R.N.Branach from http://community.livejournal.com/vegancooking/2667336.html

Ingredients
(everything is to taste, it's a super easy recipe)
*Extra Virgin Coconut Oil (or the oil of your choice, but processed coconut oil doesn't have the same taste at all)
*Any vegetable that's good for stir-frying. I always use carrots, zucchini, and cauliflower.
*Cinnamon
*Salt

Heat up a frying pan, (I always use a cast iron pan) and put in coconut oil. Cut up veggies, putting carrots in first so they can cook longer, and cover with salt to taste. Once cooked to desired tenderness, cover with Cinnamon and let them steam for a little bit.
