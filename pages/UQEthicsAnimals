Some thoughts on Aminals. 

If our ethics require us to consider the interests of other individuals as well as ourselves, and animals count as individuals, how do we decide what is in an animal's interests?


I think one possible way of looking at this is to consider the kind of life an animal would have in the wild.  So, I think it _is_ ethical to eat cows, considering that they are basically herd/prey type animals, and the life and death they experience on a cattle station is probably no worse than that they would experience in the wild.
-> *green You might want to look into that in more detail.  And what about abbatoirs? Jason*
--> Well, yes, there are better and worse ways of doing things, and I'm not saying abattoirs are particularly nice places.  But I don't think the way that humans kill cattle is on average any worse than the way, say, lions or wolves do. *purple -D*
--> *green OK.  This is good.  The extent of factory farming of cattle is increasing, and Australia is not immune, despite the rather phoney myths of the outback.  But let's leave that issue for later.  (I'll find a good link to info on the web about it, unless someone beats me to it.)  Next question: do you think that everything natural is OK?  I doubt it.  Jason*
--> Well, I suppose one would have to define "natural" and "OK".  I don't think ethical judgements can be made about nature; nature is what it is.  *green Everything is what it is.  How about a more explicit argument at this point?*
---> Okay... the nature of animals and other things is the product of evolution, not acts of a conscious being (or, if you happen to be a creationist, of a conscious being we are not in a position to judge).  So we cannot ethically judge nature by any deontological or virtue system.  Possibly, if we're taking a consequentialist view, we might think nature could be "better", but that opens up a whole new can of worms.  And I have to run 'cause I'm late for uni. *purple -D*
-->Social mores can trump (human) nature, but I don't think we're at that stage yet with eating meat or other uses of animal products. *purple -D*
---> *red Why should we have to question whether what is natural is OK? Perhaps I am out of my league here, as you all sound so smart...but since the beginning it would seem humans have eaten meat. It's a survival thing. Perhaps as we evolved, and as we grew more concious of what we were doing we decided that perhaps it was not ok to kill animals, as they may have souls too. I can't say that I'm an expert on the subject, but don't we need meat to stay healthy? Don't we need iron? It's only natural that we should get that iron from the blood of a cow, as we have always done. With pets it's another story. Pets become a part of the family, and never would we think of eating our own family. That could be the reason why some find it wrong or distasteful to eat dogs, or even horses..* -C 

And we are, in part at least, carnivorous hunting animals; I don't think we should put ourselves completely above nature when making ethical decisions.  On the other hand, factory farming of pigs or chickens is probably not ethical, as the creatures are kept in much worse conditions than they deserve.

Dogs and horses are two interesting cases, because they have been with humans for so long that they have no real "natural" state.  I think it is ethical to keep a dog as a pet, providing you treat it nicely, since that's basically what a dog _is_; all its natural behaviours have been subverted to domestication over the last several thousand years.  Horses I think are more problematic.  Is it ethical to ride, race, or use horses for labour? *purple -D*

-->*blue Is it ethical to eat horses? About two generations ago in the US, horsemeat was rather inexpensive. So a lot of people ate it, giving equestrian enthusiasts the heebie jeebies. Although I ride, I'd still enjoy the flank of a horse for a meal. This raises the question though - would it be any more inethical to butcher Seabiscuit than it would be to melt down a Ferrari for scrap? If so, why? Cheersie! -H*

*crimson I would suggest the argument should be divided into discussion regards:
1 The animals life - What is an approriate lifestyle for the individual animal?
2 Should animals be killed for human use of animal product?
3 Is there a right way to kill? 
4 Should we eat meat? 
5 Is eating meat from some species of animal more appropriate than eating others?
6 Is human use of living animals appropriate?
7 Do we include ferraris as individuals- V*

*green V, this is great.  Philosophy is all about splitting issues up like this.  (It's probably irritating that I say "philosophy is..." so much, but it's what I get paid for.  Not that that means it's what I should necessarily do.  Discuss.)  If you tell me or Adam your name, I'll ask Adam to give you lots of tutorial marks for this.

I particularly like the "Is there a right way to kill?" question.  I might see if I can show some footage of abbatoirs in a lecture.

And ten billion tutorial marks for anyone who can reorganise this page along those lines.  Don't hesitate to edit other people's words, just as long as you don't accidentally take credit for them.  Jason*



*blue 8. Do we really have to give equal weight to each individual? What happens if we decide that it might be wrong to kill an animal to eat under any circumstance. But the killing continue. In order to be more ethical, we decide to kill as few individuals as possible leading to a massive blue whale and elephant butchering spree while leaving chickens to rule the universe. -H*
 
*fawn I think the argument that eating meat is natural is a bit, well, silly. You're sitting in front of an electrical box with wires inside, wearing clothes that most likely contain synthetic substances, and are inside a building constructed out of (most likely) metal, plastics and all manner of manufactured materials and put together with the aid of machines and such. My point is humans have long since gone past what is 'natural' (in the first world at least). When was the last time you saw a lion shopping for meat at the supermarket? Humans have the ability to survive without meat nowadays. One can get iron/B12, etc. from sources other than meat. If you want to live a natural life boycott modern comforts, medicine, food, etc. and go run round naked in the bush.

I'm vegan and I'm as healthy as a horse (don't eat me because of it though). Whilst I realise not all killing can be stopped or all pain prevented, we _can_ try to minimise it as much as possible. - Jessica*

Is the distinction we are drawing between natural and unnatural a valid one? We humans are part of nature in the same way as any other animal, and something our species naturally does is think. So any ideas we come up with cannot be "unnatural", just as we wouldn't consider wolves eating other animals to be anything other than "natural" behaviour.

That eating meat is a natural thing for us to do makes sense, but I think that making a decision based on ethics or conscience or any other reason arising from human thought is just as natural. 

--> *green This is very well put.  I'm sure you're at least partly right, and I suspect you're completely right.  But here's what makes the issue less than straightforward: if you're completely right, then it's not obvious why we have the word ".natural".  Do you (or does anyone else in the class) think the word is just a mistake?  Or is it useful, but in some more subtle way than the incorrect human=non-natural, non-human=natural? Jason*

A little while ago there was some controversy in Britain surrounding the testing of medicines etc on animals. As well as animal rights protests, there were some human rightd protests, arguing that the advances in science achieved by testing on animals justified the cruelty involved. Do human rights trump animal rights? If they do, do human comforts, like shampoo tested on animals? The human desire for a really juicy steak? -A

-> I doubt advocates of animal testing would use the word "cruelty" to describe what they do. ;)  Do the rights of humans trump the rights of other animals?  Possibly, if we're collective egoists (ie, we look out for the interests of our own species first, which I think most people would).  As with most ethical issues, I don't think it's something you can be black-and-white about.  _Some_ animal testing I think can be useful and ethical, but that doesn't mean it should be open slather do-anything-you-like.

-> I think the question I posed right at the top of this page hasn't really been addressed.  How do we decide what is in the interest of an animal?  Farm animals are certainly better off as a species because of their usefulness to humans than they would be otherwise.  And I think, in the best possible world (which I would be the first to admit we do not live in), farmed prey/herd animals such as cows would be no worse off as individuals than their wild counterparts. (and I'll go into this further on .natural ). *purple -D*

->Has anyone seen that program on SBS recently where a German biologist has been dissecting human corpses and displaying them for art projects and educational purposes? Personally, I think there's nothing wrong with it if he has the donor's permission, however it seems that this could arouse differing opinions and potentially be a good source for discussion. Scientists and artists alike have been dissecting human bodies for a few hundred years now to better their scientific and anatomical understandings. However, this biologist seems to merge the two worlds. What do people think?
*red -M*

->Yeah I saw it, and I didn't watch it from the beginning so it took me a while to work out that they were actually corpses! I didn't think he was a biologist at all, I just thought he was an artist with strange artistic interests. Since the "works" were displayed in a gallery, and presented exactly as sculpture is, it definately meant you could view the human body in a different context. It seems to me that the artist was trying to highlight the beauty of the complexity of the human body, and not just come to some sort of anatomical understanding. Even when viewing the bodies in an art context I think some people were grossed out by it.
Is that an indication of how sheltered we are from death/gore these days, or something else altogether? 
And, what's more, is that related to our consumption? 
It's a pity there weren't better ways to record history, and to work out whether in times gone by, when death (both animal and human) were more part of daily life, if people reacted the way they do now. That leads me to something else; what is it exactly that people find uncomfortable about eating animals or seeing a corpse today? I am assuming that is what can turn people into moral vegetarians (ie, not ones who don't eat meat because they don't like the taste). Cage Hens and Pigs are another matter all together.


I don't know why, but I've always had issues with eating anything that's living in any way, shape or form. I never used to like eating carrots for this reason! But I think the discomfort on the topic of animal and human consumption or viewing of corpses is natural... I'm not 100% sure -but this is how I've always felt. On the other hand it could have been fed to me (pardon the lame pun)by my parents. Human's insides weird me out too. There's something very mechanical about seeing how we operate physically that seems to de-humanise us and makes us less of an individual -we're all the same on the inside. And with animals I find it aweful to think that they've perished, especially if we're then eating them. I know its part of the food chain and quite natural, but I've always had to ignore my feelings on the issue.

*crimson I am responding to the question ‘How should we interact with animals that coexist on the earth with us?’ I will divide these animals into three categories. 
1. Those that exist only because of their value to humans commercially or psychologically. This group includes animals we choose to enclose or attach to.
2. Those that exist independently in the wild. 
3. Those that live on byproducts of the human world. 
Please add other group if you feel this does not include all.

I would like to introduce here discussion of what makes a ‘good life’ quality or quantity? I believe modern humans have an obsession with length of life. I would suggest there is a general belief that a longer life is a better life, where I would question wether a shorter more joyous life is just as valuable.

Back to the animals –  group 1 - I suggest this group only exists and continues to procreate because humans choose to value them and thus assist their survival and breeding. If we choose not to make use of animals and there product we are ultimately limiting how many individuals will exist in the future. 
			- group 2 – Some of these animals are wonderfully adapted and will continue to live and multiply regardless of our intervention, but some will only survive if they move into group 1. Because humans will choose to destroy the environment in which they must live leading them to extinction or them becoming dependent on human support or assistance. However, many will be doomed regardless of our efforts to assist them which may come to late or in an inadequate manner to assure their survival.
			- group 3 – This group may or may not continue to thrive depending on how our lifestyle develops eg seagulls or cockroaches

I would suggest that the question of ‘How should we interact with animals that coexist on the earth with us?’ needs to address a multitude of issues that affect these different groups differently. For example, choosing not to eat animals will deny many animals of their existence and the subsequent pressure to provide non-animal protein sources may require substantial land clearing in order to grow plant related protein sources which in turn may lead to loss of habitat for other animals. Food for thought. V*
