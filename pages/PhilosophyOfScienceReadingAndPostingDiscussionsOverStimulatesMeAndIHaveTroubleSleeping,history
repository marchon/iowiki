*purple I recognise that it isn't very socially compatible but: Why try to force sleep, when your volitions aren't in consensus about letting you? I've probably just answered my own question - Socially problematic. I suppose what I want to say is: If all the above suggeststions fail to put you to sleep, try not to worry about not being able to sleep.

I thought so! I speak italian but there isn't an italian channel, which is a pitty because I would definitely forego some stage 3 or 4 to listen to italian in my sleep.. I've been doing a bit of browsing though and i found something else that might help! at this website 

www.librivox.org 

one can find audiobooks of many of the great philosophical works. I've just downloaded 'the antichrist' by nietzsche: 

http://librivox.org/the-antichrist-by-nietzsche/ 

and 'the problems of philosophy' by my main man Russ: 

http://librivox.org/the-problems-of-philosophy-by-bertrand-russell/

I can't think of a better way to get to sleep then to the sweet serenade of philosophy! 

Hope this helps
Lorenzo.

Pam!!! I've been doing exactly that for the past week (the accent is for some reason soothing) What a coincidence! The only thing that worries me though is this idea that if i fall alseep with the radio on, and it's playing all night every night, i will somehow not get as good a night's rest. Even worse i sometimes worry that it will effect my dreams and my subconscious mind! Does any one know if there is any substance to this or is it just superstision??

Thanks very much for the ideas. I sometimes try listening to ABC classic FM, but it doesn't work all the time. Apparently the warm milk works because it contains an amino acid called tryptophan (also in bananas and lots of other things). Tryptophan is the substrate your body starts with when it's synthesising many of your neural transmitters, especially serotonin. They reckon serotonin plays a part in sleep regulation, but it's hard to be certain. On Wikipedia they have a diagram of the synthetic pathway i'm talking about

hooray for chocolate milk

Something that I've heard about: concentrating eally really hard on just one thing and not being distracted by anything else apparently helps. So, maybe repetitive instrumental music ... or a snuggly, warm affectionate cat under the covers (the only reason I visit home, really:-) ).

I have lots of advice to the insomniacs amongst us.

If it is your brain that is the trouble:

If I have trouble sleeping it is usually because I am thinking really hard about things, solving problems, thinking about what I'm going to do tomorrow, worrying ... I recommend getting a diary, and spending half an hour writing down every possible issue that you have been thinking about. Then you feel like everything is resolved, and you can fall asleep easily! :-)

Something else that keeps me awake is light. Try drawing all curtains and face away from your window, and get a draft snake to lie at the bottom of your door, and switch off your computer and face any digital clocks or CD players away from you.

If your mind is still managing to go at a hundred miles an hour ... try doing some cryptics or logic problems before sleeping ... try really really hard ... then your brain will be too exhausted to do anything.

If you get cramps in your legs or feel twitchy and roll around and keep yourself awake that way ...

Go outside and ride around for half an hour, taking particular care to go up steep slopes a lot. Get really really puffed out. Then cool off, stretch, sit down for a few minutes, then try to sleep.

Oh and the mug of warm milk is an excellent suggestion. I don't know why it makes you feel sleepy, but it does.
