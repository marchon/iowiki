*blue Alexander Christopher Karolis

Is doing his final year in a BA(Philosophy), and plans to do Honours in Philosophy next year. He would also like to study Maths (again!) due to a renewed interest in logic.

He grew up in Sydney at Maroubra and Coogee Beach and went to Sydney Boys High School. He started a BSci(Physics) after High School at the UNSW, and decided in his final year that it was all a waste of time and ran away from home and joined the Army. The fact that his Dad had a Masters in Atomic Physics and a PhD in Bio Physics, and was generally a smart dude may have influenced his misplaced enthusiasm for physics. After spending countless years in the Infantry as an Officer, walking up very steep hills, carrying way to much on his back, jumping out of airplanes, and generally doing dangerous stuff, he decided that maybe university wasn't such a bad place to be after all.

Is interested in just about anything to do with politics, physics and philosophy, but also spends time running around in circles and writing nebulous autobiographies.

Always up for a chat, usually at 3am!
