[[[break]]]changed line 77 from: *orange {code *red Religion is in some regards a logical step in mental evolution though. 
I mean assuming the main biological drive is for survival, once you realize that everyone around you seems to die and that that means you probably will too, it makes sense for religion to form as a coping mechanism. Life won’t end with death; you’ll still be alive in another way after. Sure there are other reasons, and I’m not discounting spirituality as something so trivial, but it’s at least a small slice of an explanation. It’s also a step between knowing that rubbing to sticks together makes fire, and /why/ rubbing two sticks together makes fire. Religion seems to me just to be one of the many steps in evolution that we have taken before other animals, not necessarily one that’s unique to us.

I still think that the synthetic vs human thing is all a matter of opinion though. Consider going one step further than Helen Keller to someone in a permanent comatose non dreaming state. They're alive because they exhibit all the signs we use to define it. They’re human because they exhibit all the signs we use to define it. Because of these factors, it’s not straight set whether or not they are conscious as they don’t actually satisfy any of the prerequisites we set for that. Indeed the lines are so blurred that relatives sometimes have the opportunity to consider them already gone and to disconnect life support to allow for closure. So there’s a big emphasis on the mind, rather than the brain, as defining humanity. More to a point, there’s a big emphasis on whether or not we can socialize or interact with them.

An exact replica of a human brain modeled computationally, with every synapse and particle comprising each modeled exactly and allowed to fire as they do naturally in the real world, I would consider to be a conscious human being because it satisfies the prerequisites I consider important. Whether or not you consider it human and alive rely on the empirical methods for those things yes. But looking at it rationally as well wouldn’t necessarily change the conclusions. 

You could debate whether its better to power the comatose biological individual's life support system or the plausibly conscious and self aware virtual individual, and most people's conclusions, including mine, in the present day would be to wipe the virtual one and keep the comatose bloke. 

If you considered people a few hundred years ago, an African and a Caucasian man in the same situation would bring about the same kind of thought processes that lead us to the conclusion that the “real” person is of greater “worth” than the “related” one, leading to results that we look back on now with horror. It’s all a matter of perspective and where you place importance. 

I don’t think I should post any more here. I like the topic that I’ve managed to wander off on a tangent to, so I’m getting carried away and controlling the conversation when I should be working on things that will result in my being able to continue my degree next semester.

*black  Actually, from an anthropological perspective, the only difference between humans and animals is the formation of religious society- every ancestral group of people was initially bound together through a religion of some kind which resulted in the creation of civilization- animals have language, use tools, form social groups, and most definitely have curiosity as well as most other emotions and motivations as we do... many other forms of life could have emerged as we did, we just got lucky by circumstance...(a smaller scale version of anthropic principle for ya there).. 

as far as how much of your natural body is reducable to technology i think that once you rely completely on technology provided sense experience (brain in a jar style)you are no longer human, people need use of rational as well as empirical data of some sort (even Heller Keller could still feel and smell).

But alpacas, and lots of other non-human animals, have ``a childlike wonder of things and a need to satisfy their curiosity''.  So that can't be a necessary part of being human.  Unless you think alpacas are human.  Maybe being human involves having that quality AND being descended from us.  But that seems a bit unfair.

*red To be human:

I think “human” is just a term used to describe something central to our understanding of the world. Much like the term "Life", we change it to suit the flavour of the day, but also much like “life” we struggle with the concept that no term is absolute (so far as I know anyhow) including fundamental stuff. Depending on how you define it, a complex crystal could be identified as a life form or a virus could be defined as not being a life form. In the same way, an alien could define humans only to be those complete and faultless examples of creatures of our species (i.e. No scars or missing appendix). If I were to completely replace myself limb by limb with cybernetic whoosefopsits (technical term) and imprint my consciousness entirely into some other form, I'd still consider myself "human" because it would suit me and suit those who referred to me, not so much because I place more importance in my mind than my body, but more because such distinction is necessary. Even if I now had three arms and no eyes, I don’t see how that would be different to a blind person or someone with a mutation (whom we would hopefully all also call human). 
The brain is just an organ like any other. We place special importance on it because it’s where all the thinking happens but I don’t really see why. I’ve always thought there was some significance to the fact that I am limited to this one creature’s experiences and that that was a good reason to believe in the soul, but there’s no reason to believe that’s not just a phenomenon like many others in animals that make it place importance on its survival. 
I suppose in the end it all depends on how much importance you place on the categorising of things around you. People like to define people as homosexual, bisexual or heterosexual rather than using more complex, gapless models for things, like the Kinsey scale. We need our things in boxes or they seem unacceptably untidy.

Us in the future:
I like to entertain the notion that someone will stand on Io or Europa before I’m gone. The main reason why I don’t believe this will happen is closely linked to the reason why the word “Europa” is not in the spell checker of my shiny new no-sharp-edges version of MS Word.  A romantic can be a cynic right?
The story by Asimov  which I posted in another thread (ending in Jason directing me here) jumped forward a few stages in human evolution (of a sort) and humanity was just as endearing as I see it now. So long as any future improvements on us are still imbued with a childlike wonder of things and a need to satisfy their curiosity, I don’t find thoughts of future discoveries any less warm and fuzzy. As to the anthropocentric romanticism, if I still remembered any of my psychology I’m sure there’d be something about biological or social psychology that would explain this. 
For me though, the reason would be much more childish. I can’t fantasise about landing on new worlds properly when I have to pretend I’m an amalgamated consciousness confined to a bionic sphere that can’t taste and views the world in microwaves.  :p 

Im sorry this is so long. I know I got carried away. I just cant find a bit I want to delete. x_x

Seven...definately seven.

Although my more considered response would probably be something like: It depends on how accurately the cyber parts replicate the form and function of the biological originals. If the replication is undetectable then it doesn't matter, even superficially, because it's as is they weren't replaced - though I don't know how this'd be achieved. 

So assuming the replication is imperfect: Which body part/s are replaced and how poorly their form and function are replicated will be major contributers to the ways and extents to which the person is a different one. I'm tempted to say the brain is in a class of it's own, having special significance to personhood. Then I get to a place where I ask about the mind-body problem, which I think goes something like: Is the mind just a manifestation of the sum of the body (or certain parts of it - like the central nervous system) and so reducible to physical explanation? Or is the mind something additional - somehow attatched to the body and able to manipulate it, but not reducible to the biochemical machinations?

Unsurprisingly, I can offer no definitive solution to this problem. But maybe I have a subconscious desire to believe that humans have souls, or some sort of special existential status that can't be replicated...

No, I've decided it's seven, once you change more than seven; all the romance is gone.

Humans may develop independently replicating, learning/evolving ‘computers’ which exceed human ‘advancement’ and, independently of humans, set about colonising non-terrestrial locales, but I don’t find this notion nearly so romantically appealing.

I wonder: Do others have the same sorts of romantic attachments to the future of humans? What do others think might help explain this anthropocentric romanticism? Is there a significant sense in which I can distinguish between the carbon-based ‘biological’ progeny (‘the fruits of my loins’ or those of fellow humans) colonising the universe, and the silicon-based (or whatever) ‘technological’ progeny (the fruits of my mind or those of other humans) colonising the universe?
