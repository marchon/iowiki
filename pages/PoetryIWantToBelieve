We have been looking at extraterrestrial life so I was just wondering who is open to the idea that intelligent alien life has visited the Earth.

For this to be possible they would either have to be from planets within our solar system or if they are from elsewhere, would travel by a means that according to our laws of physics is impossible.

*green If intelligent alien life has visited Earth...That'd have to be the first time there had been intelligent life on the planet! hahaha sorry just had to. 

Why? The laws of physics don't say time travel is impossible

Or they could just have been on a longer trip. Spaceship big enough to hold  a population stable for a couple for generations before finding somewhere new to settle.

Right ... and if their technology is good enough to get them around at close to the speed of light, interstellar travel between neighbouring star systems doesn't even have to take very long, especially from the perspective of the travellers.
