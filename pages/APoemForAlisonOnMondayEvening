The violets are singing the fringes of life, in
dicating a season of mortal delight
where mouses, preceding, are followed in flight
by crimson rosellas and dragonfly night.

The violets infringing the singular gloom
are taken to speak of the sun.
But they don't mean outside, though they don't mean this room.
Violets will grow in your head.
