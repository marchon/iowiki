SCENE: BEDROOM IN AN AUSTRIAN MANSION, c.1937


GRETEL: I don't like his manner.

KURT: His attitude worries me.

LISEL: I am troubled by a general air of foreboding.

MARIA: Yes, children: my life is also, on occasion, clouded by manners, attitudes and airs of foreboding.

BRIGITA: So what do you do about it?

MARIA: Why, I simply think of nominalistically respectable things instead.

VON TRAPP CHILDREN (together): Nominalistically respectable things? What are they?

MARIA: Well, let me explain ...

-> Properties, counterparts, tropes and relations,
-> Promises, lies and confused explanations,
-> Numbers and rhomboids, and this very list:
-> These are all items which do not exist.

-> Space-time and classes and Beethoven's seventh,
-> Earthquakes and sets and July the eleventh,
-> Are, like the flutter of butterflies' wings,
-> Nominalistically dubious things ...

-> In my calm and
-> Lucid moments,
-> When I'm feeling fine,
-> I scorn the existence of all of this stuff,
-> I talk about all the time. 

MARIA: Come on children, tell me some nominalistically respectable things.

KURT (doubtfully): Er ... stones? Concrete?

LISEL (even more doubtfully): Electrons?

MARIA: Well - uh - yes, but there's much more to it than that ...

-> Raindrops and temporal slices of kittens,
-> Every third stitch in a pair of red mittens,
-> Mereological bundles of string:
-> These are all perfectly reasonable things.

-> Barmaids and walnuts and sand that's been hosed off,
-> Silver and gold and the fusion composed of
-> Alpha Centuri and Hitler's left knee:
-> All of these objects are okay by me ...

-> Things substantial,
-> Made of matter:
-> They are better, far,
-> Than some abstract nonsense but one step removed
-> From Rorty and Derrida. 

FRIDERIC: Exoskeletons!

KURT: Time-slices of undetatched heads!

LISEL (getting carried away): Statues of rottweilers! Dragons!

REMAINING VON TRAPP CHILDREN (together): Dragons??

MARIA: It's all right, children! One need have no quarrel with dragons, qua nominalist! The number two would be a far greater stain on the world's ontological purity than a mere dragon!

-> Hobbits and wizards and weapons enchanted:
-> Towering trees which Galadriel planted,
-> Rhinemaidens, giants and Nibelung rings:
-> These are a few of my favourite things.

-> Underground kingdoms and magical potions,
-> Atomless matter and bottomless oceans:
-> Though they're not terribly easy to find,
-> Nominalistically, no-one should mind.

-> Can you touch it?
-> When you hit it,
-> Does it make a "ping"?
-> If you answered "yes", then, by golly, it's real:
-> It gets to be called a THING.
