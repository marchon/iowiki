*What is it?*

Dummett trying to give a general account of what is going on in the realism debate (as well as arguing for ..anti-realist positions with regard to a few different areas).

*Where can it be found?*

Dummett, M.; 'Realism' in Truth and Other Enigmas, pp. 145 - 165.

*How does it fit in?*

It's the fundamental source for Dummett's ..anti-realist position.

*Summary*

_The realism debate in general_
- there exists a disputed class of statements (D)
- debate is with regard to whether or not the statements in D have an objective ..truth-value
-- realist: elements of D have fixed ..truth-value
-- ..anti-realist: elements of D are neither T or F
--- denies law of the excluded middle
- can be seen as a debate over the notion of meaning:
-- realist: menaing is what it is for a statement to be true
-- ..anti-realist: meaning is knowing what counts as evidence for a statement
--- hence the ..anti-realist can still give an account of how we know what statements in D mean

_Reduction_
- ..anti-realist accounts are often reductive:
-- identify some reductive class of statements R
-- element of D is T only if some corresponding element of R is T
-- but this is not necessary
