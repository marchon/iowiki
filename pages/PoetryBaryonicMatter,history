The GLAST mission is due to take off on the 3rd of June, and is probing the sky in the gamma ray region (particularly the 10 - 100GeV region), and hopes are that it will be able to detect the annihilation of WIMPS, providing bright spots of gamma rays, showing the placement of dark matter.  This is the link to an article regarding this:

For the articles on which the New Scientist story is based go to the New Journal of Physics at http://www.njp.org and look for the article by David Wiltshire in vol. 9 (2007) 377; and Physical Review Letters 10.1103/PhysRevLett.99.251101.

*blue Yeah.  The way astrophysics ``just keeps on keepin' on'' should be a big fat ..take-home message from this course, if you didn't know it already.

What's more, all sciences do this, even maths.  Astrophysics just does it faster than some of them.

Fantastic ..up-to-date research.  Thanks, Jo.

Hi again,

Don't we all love the way astrophysics just keeps keepin' on, I found an article that presents a strong case for the presence of dark energy if anyone is interested.

I received a link from HubbleSite outlining a new survey just undertaken, and, though I haven't had time to read the full article yet, the blurb says they have found a large portion of missing matter as baryons in intergalactic space.

This is the link:

Enjoy.
