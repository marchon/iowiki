The main problem I study is one which is surprisingly still an open question even though it has seemed very basic to everyone ever since the discipline of statistics took off a hundred years ago.  Suppose you've got some data; you've got some hypotheses; then what?  There's still not even a rough outline of an uncontentious answer to the question of how the data can tell us anything about the hypotheses.

I haven't got a complete solution but I've got a lot to say about categorising approaches.  Why is that useful?

It's useful because people -- both philosophers and scientists -- have been tending to focus on what I think are on the one hand one of the worst possible solutions and on the other one of the most subjectivist solutions, and have got rather stuck there.
