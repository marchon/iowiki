----
This course will demonstrate conclusively that your mind is the only thing which really exists. Don't believe me? OK, I was lying. But this course WILL seriously consider that possibility, along with other possibilities raised by philosophers of mind.

The main questions we will try to answer are:
- PART 1: What is consciousness? How human consciousness different from other animals' consciousness? What sorts of theories (if any) could explain consciousness - physical theories? Functional theories? Evolutionary theories? Are conscious thoughts ABOUT anything (e.g. about the physical world)? 
- PART 2: What are emotions? What sorts of theories could explain them? Can an emotion be described objectively? Are emotions rational? 
- PART 3: What is the relationship between minds, bodies and inanimate objects?
