##Apparently there's this thing called a tumblelog
*fawn I've been meaning to start a ..mini-blog for ages (a couple of days), but I didn't know what to call it until today, when I discovered that people are using the word ``tumblelog'' for a ..mini-blog full of short entries (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumblelog).  This is a nice coincidence, because one of the addresses of my site has always been ..tumble.tk.

So this is sort of a blog, although I don't see the point in dating all my entries.  I'll date some things.  If you really need to know the dates of other things, use ``Page History''.
