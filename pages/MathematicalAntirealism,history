Hi Dick,

Is this even vaguely relevant to this discussion?

I am an undergraduate student of Jason's, and happened across this posting while browsing xeny.net. Hope you don't mind my intrusion.

*What is it?*

The view that mathematical reality is never unknowable (i.e. that there do not exist mathematical facts/objects that we will never discover). To put it another way: there can be no unknowable mathematical truths.  (This is Moore's interpretation in the Routledge article at least.)

*References*

*Variations*
-_Intuitionism_: math. objects mind-dependent creations, thus nothing to them beyond proof.
