Recipe by etomlef (http://etomlef.livejournal.com):

- 3 cups of frozen sliced bananas. (get 4 or 5 bananas. peel and slice them up. store in freezer overnight. overripe bananas work best because they're the sweetest. this is a great way to use really mushy ripe bananas before they totally go bad).
- 1/2 cup of cashew butter
- 1/8 teaspoon of salt
- 1/4-1/3 cup of agave nectar

process the bananas in a food processor until they're chunky. add the cashew butter, salt, and some of the agave. process until smooth, occasionally stopping to scrap down bits from the sides. taste, and add more agave to preference. serve immediately, or store in the freezer.

Suggestion by some other LJ person: add pieces of strawberry or other berries.  This worked well.
