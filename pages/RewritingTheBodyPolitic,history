Abstract: N=1148 HIV-positive males in 6 health-care services throughout New South Wales were randomised to a treatment arm consisting of )re(writing the post-colonial body politic or a control arm consisting of standard treatment.  Two of the health-care services were urban (N=1147 subjects), three were regional (N=1) and one health care service was rural (N=0).  At six-month follow-up, 137 subjects who had been assigned to standard treatment self-reported as )re(writing the post-colonial body politic, possibly as a result of contamination between the arms of the study.  Analysis of the trial was therefore by intention to )re(write. Survival analysis using Cox hazard ratios showed a small non-significant benefit from )re(writing the post-colonial body politic compared to standard treatment.  These results should be interpreted with caution.
