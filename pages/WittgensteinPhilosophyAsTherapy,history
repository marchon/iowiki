-- hence there is no essence to what it is to be a language game
-- trad phil as attempt to impose strict and clear rules where there should be none
- why should one venerate ordinary linguistic use, why can't phil be used to extend our language?
-- because trad phil does not extend any practice (of a language game), rather it abandons practice, thus stripping the terms in question of their meaning
- why can't we just view trad phil as just another sort of language game?
-- because the distinctive trad phil use of a word is just to remove it from such games
--- is this question begging?
- Fogelin: Witt. wasn't trying to give a complete historical account of trad phil, nor was he trying to give a new metaphilosophical account.  Primarily he was concerned with the dissolution of particular philosophical problems.  Along the way to doing this, he made some comments about the general method he was using _in those particular cases._

*What is it?*

An attempt to develop a clear description of Wittgenstein's later account of what one should do when one does philosophy.

*Wittgenstein's Views*

There are several things that need to be looked at here.  First we need to define some aspects of Wittgenstein's later philosophy that will come into play.  Next, we need to look at his conception of traditional philosophy and how it comes to "discover" problems.  Finally we need to look at how Wittgenstein believes philosophical analysis should be undertaken

- surface vs depth grammar
- description replacing explanation
- the lack of success of the common sense approach
- the nature of traditional philosophy
- language games
-- phil investigation should never lead to criticism of a language game
- phil is not the search for truth
- problems with integrating with Witt.'s actual practice
-- engagement in criticism of traditional philosophical views as providing "counterweights".
- philosophy as therapy (offer resolution of anxieties (at least temporarily))
- problems of philosophy arise from superficially similar language games
- everything we need to resolve phil problems is already available to us
