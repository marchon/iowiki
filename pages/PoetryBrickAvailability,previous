Hi Dayal and Jason, I've just been to the Co-op and they have sold out of bricks. They received 17 from the printers and don't know when the next lot will be in. Are there any available from the Maths department? If not, could the first readings be posted on this site?
Thanks, 
Beatrix Forrest.

*crimson 17?!  God.  Thanks for letting us know.

I haven't got this week's readings in computery format, so I can't post them here.  But I can post something else instead.  I'll think of something.  In the meantime, either
- have a look a Poetry-FurtherReading, or 
- read the reading for Thursday's lecture, which I've put at ftp://xeny.net/poetry/Kuhn-And-Normal-Science.pdf.
I'll find out tomorrow whether the Maths Department has got any more reading bricks ... but I'm pretty sure they won't have enough for everyone.  Not yet.  Of course I'll make sure we get some more as soon as possible.

Jason*
