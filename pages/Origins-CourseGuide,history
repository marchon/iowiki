# Lecturer
Jason Grossman
mailto:Jason.Grossman@anu.edu.au
A.D. Hope Building room 112
phone 6125 4786
consultation time: Thursday, 12--2

# Timetable
_Lectures:_
Tuesday and Thursday, 2--3.30 (with a break!)

# Assessment
1,500-word essay (week 7): 50%
2,000-word essay (week 12): 50%

The above word counts are strict.  Anything over the word limits won't be marked.

All assignments should be submitted via the chute outside the School of Humanities office in the ..A.D.Hope Building.  You'll need to complete a cover sheet --- located in the wooden box outside the office --- and staple it to your assignment, prior to putting it in the chute.

Anything submitted late will be severely penalised, unless you have a major, unavoidable and _well documented_ excuse such as a severe illness documented by a medical certificate or a religious holiday which covers the whole period of assessment.

You can use any referencing style you like (see examples at http://ilp.anu.edu.au/citations) as long as it's consistent.  It's fine to use stuff from the Web as long as it's good stuff (just as it's fine to use stuff from books as long as it's good stuff), but beware that not all lecturers are enlightened enough to follow this policy yet.   To cite something from the Web, give both the address and the date that you consulted it (because, unlike books, Web pages can change at any time).

# Reading
You'll need a copy of ``Philosophical Analysis in the 20th Century, Volume I: The Dawn of Analysis'' by Scott Soames (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2003), which is available from the ..Co-Op bookshop for $43.16 (members' price).

# Classes
All the classes are compulsory.   If you have to miss a few, it's your responsibility to catch up, and if you have to miss a lot you won't be able to catch up.

# Plagiarism
All work submitted for assessment must be your own.  Plagiarism will receive heavy penalties and may mean you fail the course.  You're bound by the university and Arts Faculty policies at http://info.anu.edu.au/Policies/_DVC/Policies/Code_Practice_Student_Academic_Honesty.asp?tab=1.
and http://arts.anu.edu.au/student_information/current/rules/plagiarism.asp.
These policies may be obvious if you've already written a lot of humanities essays, but if you've mostly done science subjects then they may not be.  Plenty of good students fail humanities courses by plagiarising, so take this issue seriously.

Plagiarism is the appropriation, by copying, summarising or paraphrasing, of someone else's ideas or argument, without sufficient acknowledgment.  Some common types of misappropriation are described below, but students should also familiarise themselves with the full University policy.

Copying is the quotation of another author’s text, word for word, without acknowledgment.  Such quotation is only permissible when indicated by quotation marks or indentation and acknowledged by exact references.  It is not sufficient to make a general attribution or give references for some but not all of the passages copied.  References should be to the work in which the material is found: lifting references or footnotes that refer to a third work (as if it has been consulted when in fact it has not) is not acceptable.

Summarising:  To summarise the argument of other authors (for example, by isolating main points and tracing connections) is legitimate, provided it is made clear that this is being done.  However, to summarise others’ arguments, ideas or information as though they were one’s own is plagiarism.

Paraphrasing means putting an author’s meaning into different words.  This is permissible only if full and exact references are given.  A common form of plagiarism combines copying with paraphrase, repeating some words of the original text and substituting different words for others.  The more the wording is changed, the more fully the copyist may have understood the material; but it is still necessary to give the source of the ideas and of any direct quotations.

# Fun
This course should be fun.  If it's not, then probably either the lecturers are doing something wrong or you're having a general problem with university.  Either way, the lecturer might be able to help, and you should consider talking to one of them.   If you have a problem which you don't want to discuss with any of them, there are a number of other people you can talk to; a good person to start with is probably the Convenor of the Philosophy Discipline, Fiona Jenkins (mailto:fiona.jenkins@anu.edu.au).

# Student Representatives and the Students’ Association
The ANU Students’ Association (ANUSA) has two Student Representatives in the College of Arts and Social Sciences.  They can help you with problems or concerns you may have with your course or degree.  They can help you by talking to the lecturer on your behalf, help you address your concerns with assessment, and give you advice about appeals procedures.  They also sit on a number of College Committees, so let them know if you have complaints or suggestions for improvement about your courses or about facilities and services more generally.

You can contact them by emailing them at mailto:arts.facrep@anu.edu.au, or visit the ANUSA website for more information at http://sa.anu.edu.au.
