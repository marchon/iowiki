So if the northern hemisphere is going to get a moon illusion, does that mean we (in the southern hemisphere) won't?* *blue Yes.* 

*green Apparently only human beings see moon illusions?!? I wonder if that is because we haven't been able to ask a wolf (or alpaca :P) if they see it too?

*blue When that web site says ``only human beings see giant moons'', it just means that cameras don't --- i.e., they don't really subtend a larger angle in the sky.  I'm sure wolves and alpacas do see them.  Well, wolves anyway.  I don't know whether alpacas look up at night.  More observation required.

By the way, I think Otto (lead alpaca at http://gallery.xeny.net/gallery2/images/v/OurAlpacas/2007-12-Huw/alpacas+in+a+line.JPG.html) has finally learned his name!
