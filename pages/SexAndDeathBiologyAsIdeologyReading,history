I'm glad the anonymous person above remembered my point about the best scientists already knowing a lot of philosophy (and vice versa).  The number of good (and famous) scientists who know a lot of philosophy is a lot more that you'd think from the number of scientists who take philosophy courses at uni.

Either you guys who take philosophy courses are more likely to become famous than the science students who don't take philosophy courses; or the science students who don't take philosophy courses but who go on to become famous scientists are going to (most of them) catch up on philosophy in their spare time.  Or both.

Hi guys

Felix, I certainly can see where you're comming from with your comments on religion. We obviously need to be sure about what we mean by religion before being able to comment on the idea of 'science as religion'. 

From what you have said, you seem to be looking at religion as a set of rules, facts or ideologies that are set in stone and not open to debate, only to discussion. There are certainly many people whose relationship with religion would resemble this discription, fundamentalists of any persuasion being the obvious candidates.

However, there are many 'religious' people who, like in Jasons example of the best scientists being abreast of the relevant philosophical issues and vice versa, don't see themselves constrained by their faith but actually emboldened and supported by it. For people like this, their faith is actually constantly pushing them to question the accepted norms, what is 'right' and what is possible. It is not so much 'part' of them or their life as it 'defines' their identity and 'is' their life. This is what I meant when I talked of having no problems with those whose religion was science.

The example you give of the Nazi's and Eugenics I think is best seen as warping science to fit an ideology, rather than treating it as a religion. Also, while epistemological issues and debates on whether 'objective' knowledge is possible are important and interesting, it is important to take a step back sometimes and realise the fruits of the pursuit of objectiveness.

I also believe that training in the philosophy of science would greatly benifit scientists, as scientific training is surely presumed knowledge to some extent for philosophers, but I'm not sure that placing science in a box and telling it what it should and shouldn't be trying to achieve is the right way of going about it.

A model of the universe seems like a nice idea, perhaps even in a teleological sense, but science would never go far if restricted by ideologies of what we should and shouldn't be 'happy' with.

Truth, subjective though it may well be to an extent, is still stranger and more fantastic than fiction and it holds sway in our daily lives despite the objection of the subjective argument.

On the topic as science as a religion:

Although many people seem to consider science to be a 'religion', I, and all scientists that I have known and worked with understand that it is dangerous to think of science as a religion in any way.

Why?

In the simplest of terms, Science is about observing things within reality, applying hypotheses/theories to these oberservations in order to make predictions on reality, and then testing these hypotheses add infinitum in an attempt to find more accurate predictions. 

The main point here is the idea of 'predictions'. Science should never at ANY POINT claim that it has found an objective truth. The most it can do is state something is 'extremely likely'. As soon as something claims to have 'truth' or 'objectivity' it is removed from the realms of science and enters the realms of religion/belief. 

This is why the idea of science as religion is dangerous- it removes the right for other scientists and also people in general to question. To go 'hang on, you can't be sure of that, where's the evidence to support your case'. It removes what makes science applicable and unique: its constantly evolving and re-assessing nature.

Applying science like a religion only results in circumstances like the nazi ideas on eugenics. As such the idea is to be avoided at all costs, especially amongst the scientific community itself.

Ahh, I see. Thanks for you answers Jason. I now realise that I may have missed an important point. When I was refering to hybrid seed I had in mind the hybrids that Lewontin was talking about which produced increased yeild. When I gave the example of Monsanto's plants that produced sterile seed, I thought they were a further frankenstein progression of the technology. Are you implying that all seed from hybrids are sterile or just that this is occuring in some instances? If poor farmers are being encouraged to grow 'infertile' crops, as opposed to simply non-hybrid crops, then the moral arguments in opposition to that situation are VERY strong.

You both raise interesting ideas and the New Scientist question is an important one. I don't have a problem with those whose 'religion' is science. So long as they are either a) not dismissive of the possibility that there 'may' be things about life and the universe that science will never reveal, or b) open to the idea that both science and religion can be seen as different means towards the same end - like Paul Davies. I say this as someone who was raised a catholic.[past tense!] Richard Dawkins may or may not be in either of these categories. I'll let you know after I've read his book, 'The God Delusion'. :)

I've also done the readings and I have a few initial reactions. The first was one of pleasant surprise at the subject matter. A broad ranging social critique was not what I was expecting. At times Lewontin's argument explodes like lava over eminent figures in the feild of psycology and biology. Figures such as Louis Agassiz who claimed that teaching Negros too much would jeopardise their 'entraped' brains. Interestingly, Lewontin held the 'Alexander' Agassiz professorship in Zoology at Harvard from 1973. I wonder if Alexander was any relation to Louis, who was also a zoologist, and whether 'the blood told' in their lineage? I would hope not, and if so that in itself is an ironic falsification of biological determinism at one level!
I realise these are only two tiny chapters from one of his more lay-friendly books, but I still felt a little dissapointed with the lack of a fully developed argument. First, let me staple my colours to the mast. All the examples given by Lewontin in 'All in the genes?' showcase an extreme application of the deterministic ideology and were obviously rooted in the anachronistic, racist baggage of their proponents. I find the idea that biological determinism is only a part of our reality as humans to be very comforting. And NO - that has nothing to do with the fact I will probably never be mistaken for George Clooney(or even Matt Damon)...but thanks for asking.

I just think that the examples given, even in the context of these  two small chapters, should have been more properly built on and followed through. A good example of what's preventing me fully accepting Lewontin's position is the very last sentence of the first piece:

'...one is entitled to at least a suspicion that the beneficiaries of a system of inequality are not to be regaurded as objective experts.' (p.37)

Does this include him? I see from his biography that in 1992, as well as being an eminant evolutionary biologist and philosopher, Lewontin was also a white, well educated, sixty-one year old male from a self-professed upper middle class background and therefore, by his own definitiion, a likely 'subjective' commentator.

Rather than leaving me with a warm, fuzzy feeling that humans can all play an equally valuable part in the orchestra of life, equality being central to his case, I actually felt compelled to find fault with him! Are there really no studies of identicle twins raised in  'genuinely' different environments? What can 'contemporary' I.Q. tests tell us about a persons 'nature'? etc., etc. 

The information on I.Q. reminded me of Jane Elliott's 'Blue Eyed' ducumentary.This is an exercise that most are probably familiar with, at least if you ever watch SBS. If you're not, do yourself a favour and look her up. (www.janeelliott.com) I remember the way this documentary left me in awe at the way grown adults could be reduced to scared, confused, sniveling little infants.

The absurdity of the situation she inflicted on her participants directly involved the issue of I.Q. test bias and, I think, could be seen as a metaphor for the wrong-headedness of biological determinism in general. 

However, I'd be interested to read comments from anyone about their thoughts on the ethics of her approach. 

I was left with the same feeling after reading the second chapter 'Causes and their effects'. When Lewontin does deal with the actual science of the issues he raises he certainly seems to know what he's talking about. I have no reason to doubt otherwise. But despite the fact that his positions are commonly held and uncontroversial, although polemic, his arguments seem stunted and partisan. 

The hybrid seed example is a point in case. The fact(claim) that hybridisation is only one path to increasing yeild, the other being selective breeding [plant eugenics] was interesting.

OK, fair enough, but from a biological perspective rather than a political one...what's his point?

The claim that I think best sums up Lewontins position can be found on p. 31 of the first chapter:

'...we have no interest in arbitrarily defined abilities, but are concerned with diferences in the ability to carry out socially constructed tasks that are relevant to the structures of our actual social lives.'

Why is arbitrariness irrelevant? Who should decide what's socially relevant? If Lewontin's aim is to convince me that a 'Genes Eye' perspective of biology is an insufficient one (see text), he's preaching to the converted. But many of the ways he goes about trying to demonstate this come accross as being a very narrow slice of the pie. If I was fighting for my life against the 'doctrine of DNA' in the hands of fascists, I'd want Lewontin on my side. I'd also want him to be doing a better job.

Wow, excellent!  I'm almost not going to have to do any teaching on this course!

For people who don't know the jargon a teleological explanation is one which refers to an endpoint or a purpose.  So most explanations of human activities ought to be teleological (well, maybe) but most explanations of natural processes shouldn't be, and evolution's one of those.  See http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/teleology-biology/ for more details, and I've added this to the further reading page at SexAndDeath-FurtherReading.  (It's optional reading, though.)

[[[break]]]added at line 19: *lime {code    It's true that we have to be careful in how biology is used, the assumptions we make in its application (let's face it, no-one is ever entirely objective)and how valid biological research is interpreted by the public. Look at Nazi Germany- the concept of evolution, in itself valid, was warped to fit the idea that some races were 'more evolved' than others, and threfore superior. Of course, this was bull both for the reasons explained in the article that no race has been shown to be genetically superior to any other, and also because since evolution is not directional, no living race or species can really be said to be 'more evolved' than any other. The ideas biology puts forward can be used to support inborn prejudices. The same misuse of the concept of evolution has occurred pretty frequently in Anthropology, in which the questionable idea of a teleological 'cultural evolution' has been used in the past to support the very ethnocentric belief that our European culture is better, and again 'more evolved' than other, 'primative' cultures. So biological concepts can be misused and misinterpreted even outside the field of science.

Well said, Stuart. On your last point, you might find Mary Midgley's book, Evolution as a Religion, of interest. She has been called "the foremost scourge of scientific pretension in this country [England]...", if you can believe the blurb on the back of the book. She argues that science has come to function as a substitute for religion and then debunks the idea as being "nothing more than a magnificent sham".

It is really scary how often sound scientific principles get spun, misinterpreted, or even worse, completely ignored in favour of a more profitable or politically more helpful explanation, by the scientific middle men: advisors to government, pop-science writers and so on. 

Biology seems to be the worst science for this to occur, because a lot of it directly relates to us. Arguments or misinterpretations of cosmological theories, or other such esoteric problems in physics don't really matter to us on a day to day basis, yet a lot of problems in biology do.

The idea that the medical industry greatly over exaggerates its importance in our society is rather concerning, because a lot of people end up spending a lot of money they probably didn't really need to and the problem is a feedback loop.

The story of hybrid corn is also alarming. It doesn't seem sane to me that there are better methods out there, that potentially save farmers a lot of money and open up the crop production industry, that are being stifled by capitalistic politics. 

It is a very interesting question in the philosophy of science, this idea of ideologies ruling the progress and applications of science. A lot of people look to science as a replacement for religion, but it seems to me that a lot of people use science in the same way that religious dogma was/is used.
