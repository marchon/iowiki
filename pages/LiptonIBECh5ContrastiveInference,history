demonstrated above.  Although, the ..hypothetico-deductive model never really seemed that strong to begin with so one wonders how much of an achievement this really is.

*Summary*
*green Note: below summary below is only of the second part of this chapter thus far.  My notes are in a different location at present.*

This chapter takes the form of a case study of methods employed to track down the cause of increased infant mortality in a particular hospital ward.

_Explanation & Deduction_
- ~narrow inductivism:
-- can never gather all relevant data
-- relevance is often theory dependent
- hyp.-ded. method can eliminate the second problem
-- relevant only if logically implied by hyp.
- But it doesn't give an account of the source of the hypothesis.
- How are we to narrow the field of possible hypotheses?
-- contrastive evidence
-- explanatory inference
- So we have the following cycle:
-- contrastive data _leads to_ explanatory hypothesis _leads to_ experiments to collect more data
- The hyp.-ded. model then gives too much priority to the hyp. rather than its source(s).
-- And still have problem re: disjunctive inclusion.
- Furthermore, the hyp.-ded. theorist needs to specify background conditions in order to obtain logical contradictions necessary for negative inference.
-- And hence needs to give an account of the principles by which this is to be done, which is problematic.
- IBE on the other hand has the significantly lower failure standard of "failure to explain."
-- i.e. failure to specify the difference in causal histories.
-- Of course still need to decide is failure => incomplete theory or failed theory.
- Thus Popper is wrong in asserting that falsification is the only way in which theories are eliminated.
