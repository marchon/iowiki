*What is it?*

Stanford article on vagueness (less good than many of their others).

*Where can it be found?*

Sorensen, Roy, "Vagueness", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2006 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = <http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2006/entries/vagueness/>.

*Where does it fit in?*

Williamson is going to use vagueness as a case study in Ch. 2 so I thought it'd be a good idea to get some background on it.

*Summary*
Description:
- basically: a term is vague if it has borderline cases
-- distinction between relative (to a given means of determination) and absolute (Peirce: "intrinsically uncertain") borderline cases
-- i.e. resists all attempts to find ..truth-value
- compare with:
--> 1. ambiguity - (directly) having multiple meanings
--> 2. generality - covering several terms (e.g. 'child' to 'boy' and 'girl')
--- generality => vagueness (e.g. 'prime number')
- precisifications of borderline cases not judged by ..truth-values, rather by simplicity, conservativeness, and fruitfulness
- notion of truth involved in borderline cases as ..judgement-dependent (Wright & Shapiro)
- borderline status implies a loss of warrant
Philosophical Challenge (Sorites):
- base: 1 day old human is a child
- induction: if n day old is a child then n+1 day old is too
- conclusion: 36,500 day old is a child
Response:
- deny induction step:
-- Boolos: because entails conditionals like "if 2 day old is child then 36,500 day old is a child"
-- but this then implies sharp threshold
-- epistemicists (Williamson) accept this and hold vagueness to be form of ignorance
--- also involves claim that much meaning is acquired passively
- does classical logic apply to vague circumstances?
-- ..many-valued logic (up to that modelled on Reals between 0 and 1)
-- does not account for ..truth-value increase as a result of hedging
-- replacing one already overly precise tool with many, even more precise ones a bad idea? (no necessarily - series approximations)
- supervaluationism (Fine, Lewis): no ..truth-value for borderline statements
-- compounds okay if same result no matter the precisification
-- hyperambiguity: many precise concepts with close resemblance
--- problem re: vague resists mixed interpretations whereas ambiguous does not
--- but convergence to classical logic only if interpretation is uniform
--- hence ~ many inference rules (contraposition, conditional, reductio)
-- Tarski's disquotational truth convention in combination with the notion of truth at play here also seems to imply lack of ..truth-value gaps
----
*What do I think?*
- it's interesting to see these sorts of "..IBE-type" criteria being used in the context of precisification.  I wonder if the connection is more than skin deep? (probably)
- does denial of the induction step really imply that one must postulate some sort of sharp threshold?
