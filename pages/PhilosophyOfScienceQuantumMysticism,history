*red LOL used to mean "little old lady" in bridge slang. The little old ladies didn't understand it so you could talk about them without offending them. I remember a friend telling me how confused he was when he got a mobile phone for the first time and all his non-bridge friends started talking about little old ladies in sentences that couldn't make sense!*

[[[break]]]added at line 0: *lime {code Jason mentioned in the lectures that the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics is popular with Eastern mystics. Regardless of whether this is true or not, I'd like to point out that its not just that many-worlds interpretaion that is popular. 

Firstly, Bohm is very popular with mystics as well. Given that he was good friends with Krishnamurti and the Dalai Lama this is not surprising (he's even quoted repeatedly in the Tibetan book of living and dying...). But also he had an overall philosophy which incorporated ideas about consciousness as well as quantum mechanics. This combination makes him a sitting duck to be misinterpreted by New-Age mystics who say that both QM and consciousness are weird, therefore they must be related, OMG lets form a new school of mysticism with this as its basis - and we have irrefutable "proof" of this because Bohm said so. I think they interpret the weird quantum potential as being related to consciousness. The result is relatively cunning pseudoscience (maybe we should be thankful that Bohm isn't so well known).

Secondly, often mystics just refer to the general weirdness in quantum mechanics rather than a specific interpretation. Have a look at this site if you're interested: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mysticism

QM is one of the areas of physics most susceptible to abuse from pseudoscience. The more I look into it the more confused it seems to get. Having mainstream physicists like Roger Penrose talking about fundamental physics and consciousness (in the emporer's new mind for instance) doesn't help either.

*fawn Thanks for this.

What's ``OMG''?

By the way, I recommend ``The Emperor's New Mind'' for the physics and for most of the philosophy, even though I agree that the bit you're referring to probably doesn't work.
