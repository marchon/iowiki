[[[break]]]changed line 26 from: *orange {code I mentioned the crazy deep sea creatures filmed in the BBC documentary "The Blue Planet". The ANU library has the series, and after watching it all about four times, all I can say is DO IT. Not only super interesting, super-duper relevant to fleshing out an appreciation of development, ecology, evolution and some of the ways they interrelate {examples for our essays?}, but also sublimely shot, edited, soundtracked and narrated, producing nothing short of a religious experience.

That's pretty cool! Not as fun, but maybe more interesting: it's certainly more about evolution than the former game!

Ok so let's make this page the page for random bits that are relevant but aren't philosophy.

Here's a Youtube clip ripped from it the beginning of the deepsea episode, the really crazy bit with the rediculous creatures. I'm sure the BBC doesn't mind...

Not as interesting, but free - do a google search for 'darwin's pond' - it is a piece of freeware where you can create creatures, and let them compete against each other

Here's Tom hoping it comes out at the beginning of the holidays, so that he has enough time to lock himself in his room and get it out of his system before he has to start doing things again,,,
