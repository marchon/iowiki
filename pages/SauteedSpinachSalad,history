``Well my favorite salad that's easy to make and only takes 5 minutes is steamed spinach with sauteed tomato and onion. (You can sautee the spinach too with olive oil and a little garlic (fresh or powder) on the stove which is even faster, then separately sautee the sauce (which takes all of 2 minutes)...just a tomato diced up and a little red onion in long slices with salt, pepper, oregano, and garlic and mix it up with the spinach. yummy.''
