A couple of people asked for reading on Mendel, who was one of the founders of genetics.

In 1936, Fisher accused Mendel of having made up his experimental results, on two grounds:

(1)	Mendel claimed to have used only pairs of plants which different in just one characteristic, but such plants are very rare, and Mendel didn’t have time to find enough of them.

(2)	Mendel’s results are too good to be true: i.e., they’re more easily explained by wishful thinking than by genetics (modern or Mendelian).

Point (2) at least is right, according to me.  But this dispute is still controversial.

Fisher’s critique of Mendel is available at http://www.mcn.org/c/irapilgrim/men01.html.

Mendel's paper itself is available at http://www.esp.org/foundations/genetics/classical/gm-65.pdf.
