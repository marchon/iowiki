Spot anything wrong with the last sentence? One wonders how you go about implementing a search that is eternal, and therefore already implemented. Curious.

When this noxa has operated long and intensely, it turns the person concerned into a sexual neurasthenic, whose potency, too, has been impaired; the intensity of the cause is paralleled by a life-long persistence of the condition.

*ANU Philosophy Seminar Series 2006*

This is a link to a paper I gave in 2006 as part of the regular series of ANU Philosophy Seminars. It was entitled '_Life Unworthy of Being Lived: Robert Musil and Michel Foucault on Industrialised Killing_'. It has a tangential relation to my thesis, and can be found here - 

http://members.iinet.net.au/~drew.ninnis/Seminar2006.pdf

The Man Without Qualities remains my favourite book, and I think an enduring masterpiece. Who need Shakespeare when we have Musil and the modernists? Give Musil the posthumous acknowledgement he deserves!

Explaining how I acquired the last name of "Ninnis" is a long and rather dull affair relating to genealogies, old family names, and the way in which children in (what is left of) the French aristocracy inherit their names. Most frustrating is the fact that in future (rather unfortunate circumstances [i.e. death of relatives]) it may change again. It makes earning certificates and endeavour awards much more difficult.
