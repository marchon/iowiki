Alternative Set Theory:
- Pure sets are constructed by induction
- Automatically avoids the paradoxes
- Is simple and doesnt rely on 9 axioms
- Similar in many ways to Wildberger's set-up and also to hyperreals, and natural numbers

Normal J. Wildberger:
- http://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~norman/papers/Ordinals.pdf

Paradoxes of naive set theory --- basically only two? (need to check that):
- Cantor's paradox: 187?, the largest cardinal
- Burali-Forti's paradox: 1897?, the largest ordinal
- Russell's paradox: the set of sets that are not members of themselves, 1900
Philosophers argue a lot about what counts as a set-theoretic paradox and what counts as a "semantic" paradox.

# Questions to follow up

None of these compulsory (i.e. do none or more):
- Are Wildburger's infinitesimals helpful with the original problem about Cantor's infinities not being fine-grained enough?
- How are other types of infinitesimal related to Wildburger's?  Are they more helpful?
- Do alternative set theories look like they might be helpful?
