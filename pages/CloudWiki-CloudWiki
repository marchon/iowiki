This page uses a template which makes it look a bit like Cloud Wiki.

Cloud Wiki is a wiki written by Scott Dunlop (mailto:sdunlop@users.sourceforge.net) which has similar design principles to IoWiki.  It's more stable than IoWiki (less likely to crash), because it's written in a stable programming language, python, whereas IoWiki is written in an elegant but experimental programming language, Io.

Cloud Wiki is more powerful than IoWiki, but still (deliberately) less powerful than big guns like PmWiki.  See http://cloudwiki.sourceforge.net for more details.
