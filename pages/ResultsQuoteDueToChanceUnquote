The probability that the results are due to chance 

4 reasons why comparing p(e|H) with p(e|chance) is NBG: 

(1) it's not using p(H|e) 
- which leads to the ProblemOfMultiplicity & merging data
(2) it's ignoring alternative hypotheses, even though there may be some that are part of the SAME theory as H that are (in every sense) better supported 
(3) in general it needs a tail area (at least in the continuous case and 
often also in the discrete case) 
(4) Cox's paradox and related forms of incoherence -> likelihood
