*Summary*
- attempting now to deal with justification
-- in particular to show that IBE doesn't raise any new justification problems
- 2 objections:
-> 1. Hungerford's: loveliness is too subjective
-- ~: reliable inference is also subjective (cf Kuhn)
-- ~: loveliness criteria do not increase subjectivity (as a lot of them are also inferential criteria)
-> 2. Voltaire's: why should loveliness and likeliness coincide?
-- Given the problems raised by Hume, only positions that claim less use of induction than IBE can possibly be deemed better. 
-- e.g. Van Fraassen's constructive empiricism: acceptance of a theory involving unobservables really only involves belief that observable consequences are true.
--- ~: not descriptively accurate
--- ~: may not even be consistent (e.g. belief in "swarms" of particles but not the particles themselves)
-- But even this position is still vulnerable to Voltaire's objection.
-- Hence one can say that Voltaire's objection reduces to Hume's problem.
-- ~ Voltaire: our inferences are not actually all that reliable

- ..two-stage process for inference selection: 1. generating candidates; 2. selecting candidates.
-- explanation plays role in both stages

- underconsideration:
