I'm not sure that the claims about the prevelance of Gaussian distribuitions in biology are all that accurate. Biological systems tend to be chaotic. Even very simple models of populations like logistic models have some really crazy chaotic behaviour, and it seems hard to see how Gaussian distrbutions, which are pretty simple and nice and friendly, can apply to systems which have such complex structures.

Even in the data we have, it doesn't sound like normal distributions apply. Distributions arranged by weight or size would be skewed toward smaller organisms. Within a species, we might see normal distributions, but that doesn't give us a means of predicting the nature of unknown species from known ones.

Uniformity of physical laws might well imply that certain solutions are more efficient, but in the end, this is only really relevant to biological mechanisms. While uniformity MIGHT have implications for whole organisms, the number of ways of combining mechanisms to produce an organism means that there is not feasible way of determining what the most efficient combination will be, not least because the behaviours of such combinations are likely to be chaotic. In such a case, the amount of information required to arrange the relevant mechanisms into a maximally efficient organism is enormous (in fact, it's effectively infinite should the mechanisms emergent behaviour turn out to be chaotic). I don't think evolution is efficient enough to differentiate between a whole variety of fairly good solutions, and in any case, constraints and bad luck mean that determining what the best outcomes would be probably wouldn't reflect the actual organisms we'd see.

I suppose this post has been pretty random, but there seem to be two problems. The first is that Gaussian distributions are a convienient myth employed by scientists, even though their actual relevence is limited. If that's the case, using them as predictive tool is going to be tough outside the limited situations in which they apply. Secondly, even if uniformity of physical laws implies certain biological mechanisms will be maximally efficient (given their environment), once you start putting those processes together you'll get such complicated results so quickly that those efficient solutions won't give you a useful means of prediction.

To be frank, I'm positively terrified by chaos. It lurks around every turn, even in unbelievably simply systems, and even though it's really beautiful and amazing and great, it's incredibly hard to make sense of or do work with.

[[[break]]]added at line 0: *lime {code An Argument for the Uniformity of Life?

I was intrigued by the discussion in today’s lecture (14 Mar 07).  In particular I wondered if Patrick’s point about the Gaussian distribution of life might actually be quite a plausible one.  Would anyone care to comment on what they think of the following?  I would also welcome correction for any factual inaccuracies!

The point was that chance events tend towards Gaussian distributions. (*blue Aside – is there is a theoretical proof for this anyone?  I am ignorant of it if there is*).  This is often the case in biology as well – there are numerous statistical software packages (SigmaStat is a common one) that let you do all sorts of tests with Gaussian distributions, because they are so common.

If things in biology (body weight, lifespan, number of offspring etc.) often have Gaussian distributions, then isn’t it reasonable to expect that any new life form discovered (in the deep ocean, was the example from the lecture) will match what we have already discovered to be really common?

I thought the most convincing case against this was John’s point:  (1) Good data on the environments of the deep ocean does not exist, (2) The deep ocean is huge and therefore contains most of the environments on the planet, and therefore (3) what is in fact really common cannot be determined, because most of the Earth’s environments are underwater and unexamined.

 A counterpoint might come from the principle for uniformity.  The laws of physics are universal (to the best of our knowledge).  As the laws of chemistry are based on physics, and biology on chemistry and physics, this implies aspects of biology might be universal.

Biochemistry offers lots of examples of this.  The enzyme triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) is incredibly efficient.  It has a catalytic activity near its diffusion controlled limit (that is, it can interconvert trioses – 3 carbon sugars – almost as fast as trioses diffuse into it).  TIM has a barrel shape.  Considering how efficient it is, it is not surprising this barrel shape is copied again and again in many other enzymes, all throughout biology.  The ubiquity of the alpha-helix and beta-pleated sheet (really common folding pattern in proteins) also suggests that certain motifs abound because their efficiency cannot be improved upon.

This is not to say other feasible options to problems in biology do not exist.  The vast array of bacterial lithotrophs (bacteria that feed on rocks) demonstrates this.  But none of these bioenergetic options are as efficient as aerobic respiration (visit http://www.biology.qmul.ac.uk/research/staff/s-araya/redox.htm for a table showing this).   So lithotrophs occupy peripheral niches in the planet’s ecology – while processes like fermentation, and aerobic respiration are much more common.

When the planet can only offer a limited array of environments, and there are physical laws in effect, is it not possible that certain biological strategies will ALWAYS be better?  Hence leading to a knowable Gaussian distribution, and meaning we can predict what kind of life forms we are likely to encounter?  After all, aren’t guesses about astrobiology made on the basis of terrestrial life? 

Cheers,
Morgan Sheridan
