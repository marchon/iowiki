Having sold the piano to my family trust, registering a sizeable
tax gain, I made a list of all the things I DIDN'T want to do, and
determined that I would do all the others, in alphabetical
order.

When I was a computer programmer (having failed to get a
position in aardvark training etc.), I faced the problem that most
of us face at one time or another: what to say at parties when
people ask you what you do. To my surprise I got away with saying I
was an art student. I got away with saying I was a buyer for a
women's fashion store. I even got away with claiming to test-drive
tanks for a living - clearly a very implausible statement to be
coming from a 22-year-old, since "t" is nowhere near the start of
the alphabet.

this day I have never found out who pays them.

The most difficult decision of my life (possibly next to having
to decide whether to have just 5 more minutes in bed, something I
have to decide every five minutes between 7.30 and 10 every
morning) was to get a grip on my self-esteem and stop lying at
parties. Somehow I had to stop getting invited to parties. I
insulted all my friends, sported a beard with no moustache,
campaigned for VSU, etc. It didn't work. I still kept finding
myself at parties. Admittedly only my own parties, but I am nothing
if not a perfectionist.

Conducting (the next obvious career after my dismissal from IBM
for the minor offence of never having been offered a job there in
the first place) was amusing for a while, but I soon grew tired of
the Bolshoi, the New York Met and the Berlin Symphony, especially
since I hardly ever got in on stand-by. The three leading firms of
conduit manufacturers were unable to decide among themselves which
of them should take me on, and so I turned to the next career
