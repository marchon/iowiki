Justin says that C. Wright Mills, in "The Sociological Imagination", talks about using the dadaist method of throwing up the cards from his card file into the air to get random connections between them.

You enter.  A volunteer greets you and tells you a couple of rules.  On the way out, she makes sure you haven't stolen anything larger than you could conveniently fit under your shirt.  In between, she leaves you alone.

When the guide is free, they gather you into a group with a couple of dozen other visitors, and begin to talk loudly to you all.  You wander to another part of the room in the hope of looking at the house for yourself, making sure to stay visible so that it's obvious that you're not stealing anything.  The guide notices that you're not paying attention to her spiel and tells you to leave.  You wait in the café until your friends are ready to drive home.

More generally, a guided tour, as I use the term, shows you something at the same time as giving you a complete, oversimplified interpretation of it.

Obviously guided tours are bad.  I made sure of that by using the word ``oversimplified'' when defining them.

Feyerabend was opposed to guided tours of science.  A large part of his work shows this, both in principle and in detail: for example, his work on quantum mechanics [check this!] and on Galileo.

I speculate that Feyerabend's opposition to guided tours was a large part of the motivation for his dadaism.  This is wild speculation, but that's OK.  He would have liked that.

We claim that Feyerabend's philosophy of science is better described as a dada philosophy than as an anarchist philosophy, and we discuss some ramifications (for Feyerabendians) of this view.

*Introduction*

Feyerabend said many times that his philosophy of science was anarchist.  He said only once (as far as we know) that it was dada, but in that one place he emphatically supported our view:
