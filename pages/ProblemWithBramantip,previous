Alex has asked me about the problem with the validity of the syllogism form Bramantip, and he's also pointed me to a web page which answers his own question, as follows.

My example of Bramantip was:
--> All the students in my class are clever.
--> All clever students pass.
--> Some passing students are in my class.

In class, Kieran said you couldn't assert the major premise if there were no students in the class.  I said that in English Kieran's right, you can't, but in maths you can.  But I couldn't think how to explain briefly why that is.  The web page which Alex found explains it well, using the _principle of extensionality_:
