- When thinking about the topic of Branes in particular the following extract:

"Anything confined within a three-dimensional brane would look just the same as it would if the world were truly three dimensional. The other dimensions would exist adjacent to the brane, but things stuck to a three dimensional brane would never penetrate the higher dimensional bulk." (* green page 96 of reading brick*)

I began to think that if a particle or body inside the brane were capable of conscious thought would they be able to fully comprehend the existence of the outside dimensions?
For example would it be the equivalent of a bead on the Abacus which can surely see the 3rd Dimension (even if it is confined to only two dimensions) or would it be like A..Square in flatland (who can't see the third dimension or comprehend it until he visits it)?
