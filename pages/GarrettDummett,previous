*What is it?*

A summary of Brian Garrett's chapter on Dummett's ..anti-realism.

*Where can it be found?*

Garrett, What is this thing called metaphysics?, Ch. 9: Realism & ..Anti-Realism.

*Summary*

_The Dispute_
- Dummett as trying to find middle ground between idelaist and realist 
-- but still questioning independence dimension
- crux of the debate: belief in statements having ..truth-value independently of us having the means to find it
- dispute over what is the appropriate notion of truth (and thus over meaning)
- relation of disputed class of statements to a reductive class of statements (e.g. other minds and behaviour)
-- ..anti-realist: claims in the disputed class actually amount to claims in reductive class
- note that reductionism is not related to the realist debate in any simple way (see Metaphysics.Realism for more on this)
-- in particular not necessary or sufficient for ..anti-realism

_Case Study: Character_
- Under investigation: "Jones was brave"
-- with no possible evidence as to Jones' bravery
- Want to assess truth of counterfactuals: "if jones had been exposed to danger, he would have acted bravely" & "if jones had been exposed to danger, he would not have acted bravely."
-- Dummett: counterfactual can only be true in virtue of some categorical statement
-- ..anti-realist: neither counterfactual T => "Jones was brave" is neither true nor false
-- realist: one or other of the counterfactuals T
- Dummett then argues that one would have to be naive to be a realist about character
-- *green but no details of argument given, will ahve to look into this*
-- BG: ~this on basis that it is intuitive to think about psychological states giving rise to behaviour
--- Hence Dummett characterised as a naive behaviourist.

_Case Study: The Past_
- looking at statements about the past that we will most likely never have evidence for
- Dummett: realist needs to appeal to ..truth-value links between present and past tensed statements
-- need grasp of this link to gain understanding of what it is for statement re: past to be T
--- problem: this seems to assume that the realist admits that there is difficulty re: past statements
--- looking to ground statements re: past in statements re: present

_Maths_
- does appear to be a reasonable categorical difference in case of maths: when don't have proof or ..counter-example
-- *green But does this mean that Dummett would accept that one can be a realist re: mathematical properties that have been proved?*

_Dummett's Motiviation_
- D: Can't understand what it is for a statement to be T without what we've learned to treat as establishing its truth.
-- *green This seems quite pragmatic, presuming that we learn ..truth-establishing in a social way.*
- prob re: Goldbach Conjecture: seem to know what it means without having ability to show it is true
-- *green I think this highlights the large amount of contextual consideration at play in the background of Dummett's position: consider for e.g. how Goldbach's Conjecture woulf be treated in other areas of science (where inductive inference is accepted as valid).*
- ..anti-realism as an attempt at improving logical positivism
