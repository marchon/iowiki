I could implement more sophisticated spam-blocking mechanisms, and I've experimented with a few, but this is my favourite at the moment, for reasons which I hope to document later.  In particular, it's deliberate that users can't lock or password-protect their own pages.  The point is to encourage collaboration.

*Page Templates*

You can edit the page template for your wiki using a URL like
http://localhost:8080/PageTemplate?action=edit&password=blithnock.  Replace ``localhost'' with your server's address if necessary, and replace ``blithnock'' with the template password you set in ..config.io when you followed the installation instructions above (if you did).

If you like, you can have separate page templates for separate projects in a single wiki.  You can edit the page template for the project Wombat, for example, at
http://localhost:8080/Wombat!PageTemplate?action=edit&password=blithnock (with replacements as in the previous paragraph).  But see walled.gardens for cautionary notes about separate projects.

All the page templates on a site share the same password.  If you need to use two or more passwords, run two or more copies of ..IoWiki with different port numbers.

You can display a page with an arbitrary template: http://localhost:8080/AdministratorDocumentation?template=ReadMe, http://localhost:8080/AdministratorDocumentation?template=Wombat etc. This is useful for saving pages in a format suitable for (e.g.) printing or saving as static HTML.

*Apparently Read-Only Pages*

*Restoring Spammed Pages*

A URL like http://localhost:8080/PageName?action=restore will restore a page to how it was before the last edit.  (This restoration itself counts as an edit, so if you do it twice in a row you get back the page you had before you did it the first time.)

Or you can give it any other regular expression.

*Secret Markup*

Nothing very exciting here, but {code [[[version]]]} is replaced by the name of the version of IoWiki you're running.  And there is secret markup to let you write [[[(]]] and [[[)]]] --- edit this page to see what it is.
