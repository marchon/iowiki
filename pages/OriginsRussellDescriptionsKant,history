To be honest Russell is pissing me off, he wants to say all these things about the way we can describe essential and non-essential things, but as Jason pointed out in the lecture, there really is very little left that is essentially real, that is what we know by acquaintance. So what really is the point!

I was reading Russell's Chapter XVI Descriptions in Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy - and on pp169 Russell states: "Logic, I should maintain, must no more admit a unicorn than zoology can; for logic is concerned with the real world just as truly as zoology...", and on pp170 he continues: "The sense of reality is vital in logic".

Now this seems a similar distinction to the one Kant makes regarding Pure General Logic which deals with the subject and predicate, and Transcendental Logic which deals with substance and properties.

Any thoughts?
