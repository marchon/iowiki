[[[break]]]changed line 4 from: *orange {code -- methodological difference is not that deep (cf. mathematics)
}*[[[break]]]to: *green {code -- methodological difference is not that deep (cf. mathematics as an "armchair science")
}*[[[break]]]changed line 11 from: *orange {code 
}*[[[break]]]to: *green {code - plurality of phil. methods
- few phil. questions are distinctively conceptual
- there has been a failure to adequately articulate philosophical methodology
-- and often undertaken without clear view of alternatives
- phil. should not be seen as aimed at stabilisation of beliefs
-- need to deal with the knowledge of the world in our "starting point" too
- ~conducting opinion polls among ..non-philosophers in order to draw philosophical connections (cf. Papineau)
- no radical new methods, just better application
}*[[[break]]]changed line 15 from: *orange {code 
}*[[[break]]]to: *green {code - indeed, most of what goes on here is just hinting at what's to come so it'll be better to react to the points above when they appear in a more fully "fleshed out" context
-- I'll be especially interested in what he does with this starting point stuff

[[[break]]]added at line 2: *lime {code - is going to question how significant the gap between supposedly a priori philosophy and a posteriori natural science is
-- methodological difference is not that deep (cf. mathematics)
- will also deal with how we react to a priori nature of philosophy
- rough distinction between rationalism and empiricism on basis of whether a priori is seen as virtue or vice
-- move from crude empiricism to naturalism sometimes just involves adding naturalism to a priori commitments
--- *green should track exactly how this is supposed to work when it ..re-emerges*
- should we scale down the ambitions of philosophy?
-- just analyse conceptual/linguistic apparatus brought to bear in a posteriori investigations
}*[[[break]]]added at line 5: *lime {code - will be interesting to see how he goes on to characterise naturalism (if he does) and what impact different characterisations may have on his arguments
