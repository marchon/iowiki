[[[break]]]changed line 1 from: *orange {code ##Apparently there's this thing called a tumblelog
*fawn I've been meaning to do this for ages (a couple of days), but I didn't know what to call it until today, when I discovered that people are using the word ``tumblelog'' for a ..mini-blog full of short entries (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumblelog).  Except that I think tumblelogs are meant to be full of pictures and video.  Anyway, this is a nice coincidence, because one of the addresses of my site (although not the only one) has always been ..tumble.tk.

So this is sort of a blog, although, unlike a blog, I don't see the point in dating all my entries.  I'll date some of the things I write.  If you really need to know the dates of other things, use the button called ``Page History''.

#Asymptotics
I'm getting increasingly cranky about statistics textbooks which write

-->lim (x&#8594;&#8734;) [a - b] = 0

and then explain that this means that as x increases a ``gets closer and closer to'' b (actual quote; citation omitted to protect the guilty).  Of course it doesn't mean that!

At least, it doesn't mean that in general (and meaning things in general is, er, meant to be the whole point of maths).  It does in the examples the author has in mind, but if *that's* what the author wants to say then the mathematics that goes into proving the asymptotic result is irrelevant.  The best one can say, if all one has is the asymptotic result, is that it's a clue that for actual values of x, as x increases, a is *likely* to get closer and closer to b.  It's only above *some* large value of x, unknown, that a is guaranteed to get closer to b.

Elsewhere I'm rebutting this sort of thing in detail for a couple of specific cases (unbiasedness and completeness, in case you're interested, both of which have asymptotic definitions).  But I'm cranky about almost all asymptotic definitions in statistics, not just those two.  And maybe almost all asymptotic definitions in applied maths, come to think of it.

Here's an interesting new open-access journal: Rejecta Mathematica (http://math.rejecta.org).

And for anyone who cares about programming languages: an interesting new implementation of Smalltalk at http://code.google.com/p/syx.  Free and open source (unlike most of them), available from the command line (unlike Squeak), and hopefully less buggy than GNU Smalltalk.

And a beautifully simple advent calendar at http://isitchristmas.com.

#spam
Another page got spammed today: CouscousWithBakedOnionsAndStuff.  How do the spammers choose which pages to spam?  It's weird.  Here are the pages which have been spammed so far:
HomePage
Photos-Alpacas
.Quotations
MediaWiki
IoWikiInstructions
CouscousWithBakedOnionsAndStuff
----
I guess entries have to go backwards --- i.e., up the page.  Otherwise, anyone who reads this (if anyone does) will always be starting by reading old entries.  Hm.  Well, that's how other tumblelogs seem to do it.
#Hooray for Danya Alexeyevsky
For years, my wiki program --- the one which runs this site --- has only worked with an old version of the Io programming language, which has lead to various problems.  Now you may think that nobody reads this site (that's sort of a joke), but Danya Alexeyevsky not only reads it but has massively improved it by updating the program to work with the latest version of Io.  Or at least, they've done that with a slightly old version of my program (my fault: I hadn't made the latest version available), but now that Danya's done the hard part it will be relatively easy to get the latest version of my program working with the latest version of Io, and then everything will be good.

One day there might even be more than one site using this program.  And that might be a good thing, because even though I'm one of the world's crappest programmers I think I've got the _design_ of this wiki (by which I really mean its _feature set_) just about right.  And it's a small program, so it shouldn't be hard to get most of the bugs out later.

More about my program: IoWiki.  More about Io: http://iolanguage.com.

I've forgotten what I wanted to write in my first entry.  Although here's something else to write instead:
#Tags
``I have yet to find something textual using a tag that I wouldnt have found faster using Google. In fact I sometimes Google my ..del.icio.us bookmarks rather than try to figure out what tag I {used}.''

I'm getting increasingly cranky about statistics textbooks which write

a -> b as x -> infinity

and then explain that this means that as x increases a tends to b.  Of course it doesn't!  At least, not in general.  It does in the examples the author has in mind, but if *that's* what the author wants to say then the mathematics that goes into proving the asymptotic result is irrelevant.  The best one can say is that the asymptotic result is a clue that for finite values of a and x, as x increases a is likely to tend to b.  Which is never ever what the books say.

I'm rebutting this sort of thing in detail for a couple of specific cases (unbiasedness and completeness, in case you're interested, both of which have asymptotic definitions).  But I'm cranky about almost all asymptotic definitions in statistics, not just those two.  And maybe almost all asymptotic definitions in applied maths, come to think of it.

This is for the sort of thing which other people put on a blog, although I _still_ don't see the point in dating all my entries.  I'll date some of the things I write.  If you really need to know the dates of other things, use the button on the right called ``Page History''.
