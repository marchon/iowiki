[[[break]]]added at line 0: *lime {code brief version:

Ferry to Kurraba Wharf, which is in Neutral Bay and which is on the Neutral Bay ferry line but which is not the wharf called "Neutral Bay".  Trip time around 20 minutes.  Timetable to be posted here soon.

Then phone me or go up the steps to the street, turn right, go past a small shop and about 6 houses until you see number 135; then go right down to the bottom of the driveway and then into the building on the left.

Longer version and maps to appear here in due course.
