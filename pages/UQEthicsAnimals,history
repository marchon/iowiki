[[[break]]]added at line 66: *lime {code *crimson I am responding to the question ‘How should we interact with animals that coexist on the earth with us?’ I will divide these animals into three categories. 
1. Those that exist only because of their value to humans commercially or psychologically. This group includes animals we choose to enclose or attach to.
2. Those that exist independently in the wild. 
3. Those that live on byproducts of the human world. 
Please add other group if you feel this does not include all.

I would like to introduce here discussion of what makes a ‘good life’ quality or quantity? I believe modern humans have an obsession with length of life. I would suggest there is a general belief that a longer life is a better life, where I would question wether a shorter more joyous life is just as valuable.

Back to the animals –  group 1 - I suggest this group only exists and continues to procreate because humans choose to value them and thus assist there survival and breeding. If we choose not to make use of animals and there product we are ultimately limiting how many individuals will exist in the future.

			- group 3 – This group may or may not continue to thrive depending on how our lifestyle develops.

I would suggest that the question of ‘How should we interact with animals that coexist on the earth with us?’ needs to address a multitude of issues that affect these different groups differently. For example, choosing not to eat animals will deny many animals of their existence and the subsequent pressure to provide non-animal protein sources may require substantial land clearing in order to grow plant related protein sources which in turn may lead to loss of habitat for other animals. Food for thought. V*

I don't know why, but I've always had issues with eating anything that's living in any way, shape or form. I never used to like eating carrots for this reason! But I think the discomfort on the topic of animal and human consumption or viewing of corpses is natural... I'm not 100% sure -but this is how I've always felt. On the other hand it could have been fed to me (pardon the lame pun)by my parents. Human's insides weird me out too. There's something very mechanical about seeing how we operate physically that seems to de-humanise us and makes us less of an individual -we're all the same on the inside. And with animals I find it aweful to think that they've perished, especially if we're then eating them. I know its part of the food chain and quite natural, but I've always had to ignore my feelings on the issue.

That eating meat is a natural thing for us to do makes sense, but I think that making a decision based on ethics or conscience or any other reason arising from human thought is just as natural. 

A little while ago there was some controversy in Britain surrounding the testing of medicines etc on animals. As well as animal rights protests, there were some human rightd protests, arguing that the advances in science achieved by testing on animals justified the cruelty involved. Do human rights trump animal rights? If they do, do human comforts, like shampoo tested on animals? The human desire for a really juicy steak? -A

*fawn I think the argument that eating meat is natural is a bit, well, silly. You're sitting in front of an electrical box with wires inside, wearing clothes that most likely contain synthetic substances, and are inside a building constructed out of (most likely) metal, plastics and all manner of manufactured materials and put together with the aid of machines and such. My point is humans have long since gone past what is 'natural' (in the first world at least). When was the last time you saw a lion shopping for meat at the supermarket? Humans have the ability to survive without meat nowadays. One can get iron/B12, etc. from sources other than meat. If you want to live a natural life boycott modern comforts, medicine, food, etc. and go run round naked in the bush.

I'm vegan and I'm as healthy as a horse (don't eat me because of it though). Whilst I realise not all killing can be stopped or all pain prevented, we _can_ try to minimise it as much as possible. - Jessica*

Perhaps I am out of my league here, as you all sound so smart...but since the beginning it would seem humans have eaten meat. It's a survival thing. Perhaps as we evolved, and as we grew more concious of what we were doing we decided that perhaps it was not ok to kill animals, as they may have souls too. I can't say that I'm an expert on the subject, but don't we need meat to stay healthy? Don't we need iron? It's only natural that we should get that iron from the blood of a cow, as we have always done. With pets it's another story. Pets become a part of the family, and never would we think of eating our own family. That could be the reason why some find it wrong or distasteful to eat dogs, or even horses..* -C

[[[break]]]added at line 8: *lime {code --> Well, I suppose one would have to define "natural" and "OK".  I don't think ethical judgements can be made about nature; nature is what it is.  Social mores can trump (human) nature, but I don't think we're at that stage yet with eating meat or other uses of animal products. *purple -D*

[[[break]]]added at line 7: *lime {code --> *green OK.  This is good.  The extent of factory farming of cattle is increasing, and Australia is not immune, despite the rather phoney myths of the outback.  But let's leave that issue for later.  (I'll find a good link to info on the web about it, unless someone beats me to it.)  Next question: do you think that everything natural is OK?  I doubt it.  Jason*

[[[break]]]added at line 0: *lime {code Some thoughts on Aminals. 

If our ethics require us to consider the interests of other individuals as well as ourselves, and animals count as individuals, how do we decide what is in an animal's interests?

Dogs and horses are two interesting cases, because they have been with humans for so long that they have no real "natural" state.  I think it is ethical to keep a dog as a pet, providing you treat it nicely, since that's basically what a dog _is_; all its natural behaviours have been subverted to domestication over the last several thousand years.  Horses I think are more problematic.  Is it ethical to ride, race, or use horses for labour? *purple -D*
