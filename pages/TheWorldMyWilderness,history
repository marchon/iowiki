Not as great as TheTowersOfTrebizond, but then apparently everyone says that.  The down sides are some rather slack descriptive passages, and some extremely unrealistic working class dialogue.  But there isn't much of the latter.  And the main characterisations, and the plot, are both fantastic.  So on the whole it's just fine.
