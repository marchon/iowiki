#web sites
Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org) is good for brief biographies of the people we'll be studying.

The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (http://setis.library.usyd.edu.au/stanford/contents.html) is a very good online encyclopedia of philosophy.  Unfortunately, the categories it uses don't line up particularly well with the categories we need for this course.  (E.g., there's no separate entry on ``semantics''.)  But you might find bits of it useful anyway.
