I have been struggling with the concept of Falsificationism for weeks (and have been too distracted with study to write anything about it until now!)

I feel the main reason I struggle with the concept of Falsificationism is because I view science as quite the opposite. It seems to be drilled into my head that scientists develop a hypothesis about some phenomenon or another, and then set out to test it. They produce results that either confirm or disconfirm their theory; hoping, of course, to find data which confirms their hypothesis. If I understand Falsificationism correctly, scientists would set out only to find data that disconfirms their hypothesis, rendering all work on their theory useless and a waste of time. Now, why would someone who has spend years (and money) developing a model or theory about one phenomenon proceed to spend more time trying to prove the development wrong by falsifying it? (Unless one scientist develops the theory and yet another is 'responsible' for finding data which goes against it?) This just does not make sense to me! I don't recall Jason telling us the general reaction from scientists to the idea of falsificationism...
                  -> *blue I don't think there is a general reaction. Why would there be? Some scientists have liked falsification very much. Some haven't. Jason* 

I have been able to accept or understand most of the other topics we have covered in the course (although some I feel need to be taken with a grain of salt) but I just cannot seem to see the value of Falisificationism. Is anyone able to convince me otherwise?

- One reason is that some people are thinking of a weak version of falsificationism, which says that we should try both to confirm _and_ to falsify our theories, but we should put a bit of extra welly into falsifying them in order to overcome our psychological biases which would otherwise lead us to find lots of confirming evidence for our theories and never seriously look for any disconfirming evidence at all.  This is very plausible, no?
-> This weak version of falsificationism is not Popper's version --- i.e., it's not the version we studied.  I don't know any philosophers who mean this weak version when they say ``falsificationism'', but there probably are some.
-> Some people confuse this weak version of falsificationism with Popper's strong version (they don't realise that they're different).
- Another reason is that some people think, for purely technical reasons, that confirmation simply isn't possible.  I wouldn't expect you to agree with that.  I certainly don't.  But it's an interesting issue, with arguments on both sides.  I can suggest plenty of things to read about it.  The only thing is that you have to be willing to read about statistics.  That's why I didn't discuss it in full in the course.

Hey Sammy,

I remember thinking about Popper's falsificationism with reference to science as aiming to describe mind-independent reality vs science as instrumental.  So I thought of it as Popper saying we can never ascertain the "truth", we can only corroborate theories.  Theories always have the potential to be falsified, so we can never say definitely, absolutely, that some theory matches reality.   

You asked "why would someone who has spend years (and money) developing a model or theory about one phenomenon proceed to spend more time trying to prove the development wrong by falsifying it?"  - I don't know if popper thinks you should explicitly set out to falsify the theory.  rather you should corrobate it to the best extent you can, being aware that your theory has the potential to be falsified.  We do always say a hypothesis has been supported rather than proved, so I guess by wording the results of experiments this way we are recognising falsificationism.

Maybe making an argument about how WELL a theory is corroborated is the complicated/difficult thing, and that is why Jason referred to the use of complex statistics?  

Maybe your trouble with falsificationism arises from you thinking of science in an instrumental way?  If we perform science for its pragmatic value, I don't really care if something has the potential to be falsified if it has clear pragmatic value.  Eg, If a vaccine has been corroborated by a billion people being protected from some disease, I don't really mind if the theories that led to its invention do not strictly correspond to a mind independent reality.  

BUT i have not been thinking very much about philosophy of science lately, bc i have an english essay and a sociology essay to write, so forgive me if my interpretation is misleading/diverges from what popper meant.
