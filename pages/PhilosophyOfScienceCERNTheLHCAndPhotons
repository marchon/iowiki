Today in the tute we were talking about two very interesting things. Firstly, the contentious issue of whether or not scientists at the ANU actually teleported a photon. Here are their pleadings first hand:

Second, we were speaking about the Higgs boson, one of the elementary particles predicted by the standard model of particle physics but not yet actually observed. Wiki has a particularly good article on this:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson

And finally, the people who are trying to discover the Higgs boson, CERN. They are a European centre for nuclear research and are, as we speak, putting the finishing touches on an absolutely massive particle accelerator called the LHC (large hadron collider). More info here:

The wonderful people at CERN have built a particle accelerator (a doughnut shaped magnet) that is so huge it extends underground through parts of France and Switzerland. The hope is that when it comes on-line later this year and they are able to smash particles together at speeds not achievable on current machines, the Higgs boson will pop out.

I for one have my fingers crossed.
