In my experience, their service is very good. Just go to the site, type Ladyman into the search field, click on "Author", and voila! Both the hardback ($186.30) and paperback ($52.20) types are available. The downside - $6.50 for postage and handling. They accept credit cards, internet banking, cheques and money orders. Hope this helps.
