- There could be a problem with companies which produce morbidity and then claim money for drugs to treat it.  E.g. Nestlé's breast milk substitutes (and analgesics, antidepressants etc. with major side effects).

- Practically all pharmaceutical firms are already running post-marketing surveillance of the use of their products (..a.k.a. ``phase 4 trials''). --- but generally not in poor countries.
-- Can we avoid introducing incentives for them to distort the results?

- On estimates of the cost of the proposal based on the current cost of pharmaceutical research:
-- Current costs are inflated by tax breaks for R&D and by high salaries and high profits, none of which would be necessary (although of course they would remain desirable for the companies) in the proposed new sector.
-- Why not start small? --- answer: see below.

- On allocating rewards:
-- Can we restrict our attention to prevention of death?
-- Drug cocktails are difficult because there's no uncontentious way of doing a multiple regression.  Bayesianism might help by getting rid of several ad hockeries (most notably the ad hockery of labelling some parameters as nuisance parameters) but it has its own problems. --- Drug companies can work this out among themselves.

- The project has to bear the cost of getting good enough data on causes of death.
-- Death certificates are often filled in inadequately, e.g. by lay people especially in Africa; also note that there's usually a single cause of death.

- Only need to sample, of course.

- Thomas suggests: give money to drug companies on the assumption that their drugs are causing all of a reduction in disease.  Since many governments spend practically zero on reducing disease, this is a reasonable approximation.

- Have to think about cases in which governments would reduce their expenditure if this program came in.
