[[[break]]]changed line 5 from: *orange {code => I have also been doing a bit of reading on the Axiom of Choice. This is very interesting!!!! It seems that most working mathematicians quite happily accept the axiom of choice. There was a "Constructive Analysis" movement in the 1970's which attempted to replace AC with the axiom of countable choice -very interesting, I will find more information about it tomorrow. AC is the least constructive statement about mathematics I have every seen! It leaves me with a bit of a funny taste in my mouth... An interesting question seems to be: if AC asserts the existence of this 'choice function' for collections of non-empty sets, are there any of these choice functions which would be outside the scope of human comprehension or definability? (answer is most likely- yes) How do we define these terms 'find', 'comprehend', 'define'? If the Anti-constructive nature of AC is what we dislike, then is there a middle ground between ZFC and Brouwer's (spelling, sorry) Constructivism??

[[[break]]]added at line 0: *lime {code => I am working through "New Foundations" by WVOQ. This is very interesting, but there is still a few points I am not quite clear on.
 
Constructive Set Theory has also caught my attention... No has been able to prove that Heyating (spelling - the 'a' is in the wrong place, I'm sorry) Arithmetic can be represented within constructive set theory, is that right? hmmmm.... is this a problem for the constructivist ideal?? (I think not).

=> I have also been doing a bit of reading on decision theory... This seems to be an area which is very active at the moment... 
 
=> What IS the philosophical significance of BTDF? (I will get back to you)...
