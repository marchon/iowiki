[[[break]]]changed line 8 from: *orange {code *red Thanks Jason.  I'll deal with green first.  Egad! I made a typo.  I am glad you don't agree with `EBM doing well to inform therapeutic decisions'; it doesn't, it's horrible at it.  I forgot the _NOT_; now fixed.  Re the fawn part: I might not be using the best word in `inconsistent'.  Any way I am not sure that (i)-(iii) will be three separable parts.  Rather each chapter will attack all three.  Say, Chapter 1: An interpretation of the hierarchy; Chapter 2: Why Randomise; Chapter 3: Therapeutic Decisions and the Problem of External Validity; Chapter 4: Statistical inference in EBM: General Principles; Chapter 5: Statistical inference in EBM: Rofecoxib; Chapter 6: A Philosophical Framework for EBM (if you still want to call it that).  Progress report: I am about half way through Chapter 1.  Chapter 2 and 5 is pretty much done.  Chapter 4 I am looking forward to, and I think old versions of the rofecoxib paper will help.  Chapter 3 needs doing, and there is a chance it could turn into a monster.  Perhaps I will have to split it.  (And thinking a little more, it might have to come after the `statistical inference' chapters.) And Chapter 6 (I hope) will be summarising the positive threads from the earlier chapters. Adam*

[[[break]]]added at line 5: *lime {code *fawn I think this is a good plan, but the later parts of it are the going to be the best parts, so I suggest that you keep (i) short and/or add another point or two to it (which is probably what will happen of its own accord).  The thing is that of course the justification for EBM is inconsistent.  The justification for any huge project that's put together by so many people is going to be inconsistent.  That's well worth saying, but it's not as exciting as what you're going to say under (iii).  Unless I'm missing something.  Jason*
*green By the way, I have a problem with the idea that ``EBM does do well in informing therapeutic decisions''.  I don't think EBM does well in informing therapeutic decisions compared to the improved version of EBM which you're going to be suggesting.  And if that's not what you're comparing it to, then what?  OK, maybe it does better than what we had before EBM; but then (despite what the EBM proponents say) it's not actually that much different from what we had before EBM, so that's a very hard comparison to make.
