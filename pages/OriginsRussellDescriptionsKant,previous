*blue Okay this may be a shot in the dark at this stage.

I was reading Russell's Chapter XVI Descriptions in Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy - and on pp169 Russell states: "Logic, I should maintain, must no more admit a unicorn than zoology can; for logic is concerned with the real world just as truly as zoology...", and on pp170 he continues: "The sense of reality is vital in logic".

Now this seems a similar distinction to the one Kant makes regarding Pure General Logic which deals with the subject and predicate, and Transcendental Logic which deals with substance and properties.

Any thoughts?

*crimson I'm going to say a lot about unicorns, but not with respect to Kant.  Anything anyone could add about Kant would be very helpful.

*blue Okay here is a quote from Altman M.C. (2008) Companion to Kant's CoPR: "Pure General Logic concerns liguistic concepts, whereas the categories (Transcendental Logic) relate to representations..." Basically if I (pure gen) logically say if A then B then I am making a statement about the relationship of A & B, so I could substitute the terms as to say anything. But if I say when the clock reaches 6am the sun will rise, I run into the problem of Humes Skeptic argument against induction, so Kant moves (transcendental) logic to the a priori understanding (pure synthetic unity of apperception) and makes Causality a category. Therefore since causality is a priori and no longer empirical saving it from Hume BUT leaving it as an 'objective' claim about the 'empirical real' world, albiet through transcendental idealism, so it is only our/your real world. Now is that what Russell is doing with his knowledge by acquaintance, knowledge by description? It looks like it to me, but I haven't really explained it very well, sorry.

*blue Some more ranting, but I promise I am not attempting to conflate Russell and Kant! It is just very interesting! In B148-9 Kant says: "Only our sensible and empirical intuition can give to them (by them he is referring to the pure concepts of understanding - that is transcendental logic - that is 'the categories') body and meaning." Now what is VERY interesting about this passage is that Kemp Smith who translated this edition of Kant has footnoted 'body and meaning' as referring to Sinn und Bedeutung'. Now if that doesn't send shivers down your spine your either unconscious or think I am a lunatic.

Okay I will write it all out in an Alexised version.

Kant: "Only OUR sensible and empirical intuition can give to Transcendental Logic its Sinn and Bedeutung."

(B148-9 refers to Kant's 'Critique of Pure Reason' page 163 in the Kemp Smith Edition.)

*crimson If what Kemp Smith meant was that Kant used the German words ``Sinn'' and ``Bedeutung'' then that's completely fine but doesn't get us very far, since they're common German words with many meanings.  Otherwise, if Kemp Smith meant that Kant used Frege's concepts (before Frege, of course), then I wonder what the justification is.  And I'm dubious, because the meaning of Sinn is pretty specific.  Bedeutung is a safer bet, because it's a concept which most philosophers have used, although come to think of it Kant is arguably an exception, because his theory of reference is very different from Frege's.

As for the rest, without being a Kant expert, I think what you say is very plausible.  And very interesting indeed.  But not too surprising.  Russell's initial philosophical education was largely in the German tradition, as was everyone else's at the time.  When Russell was a student, in the 1890s, it almost went without saying that Kant was the greatest philosopher ever.

*blue I agree that it is highly unlikely that Kant meant anything like Frege's Sinn, though it is possible he had bedeutung in mind. I guess what I found interesting was that in Russell's phenomenalism he is attempting to quantify knowledge into what we directly perceive, and then describing his logical theory of description around that. I guess Kant is saying that we have our logical categories of understanding that determine our a priori conditions for knowledge of sense data. But of course sense data is very limited, in fact it sounds to me as if Russell more an idealist in the Berkley sense rather than Kantian.

To be honest Russell is pissing me off, he wants to say all these things about the way we can describe essential and non-essential things, but as Jason pointed out in the lecture, there really is very little left that is essentially real, that is what we know by acquaintance. So what really is the point!
