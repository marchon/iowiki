If like me you haven't managed to get a copy of the textbook you may find this useful.

Google has a copy of the entire book available on Google Books for you to read. There doesn't seem to be any easy way to print it off, so its probably not a replacement for the real thing, but it should help in the mean time.

Incidentally, if you are sick of hassling the co-op bookshop to get copies in, I found the book on a internet bookshop for about $52 with free delivery. I only ordered mine the other day so I haven't got it yet, but I have ordered from them before and they are pretty good.

Hope this helps.

*blue Goodonya.

Also, I've photocopied Chapter 1 but forgot to bring it to the tutorials.  I can give it to the couple of you who still haven't got books at Tuesday's lecture.

*green my friend said to try uc's co-op, they might have it? has someone already tried that? - pam*

*red I propose a total boycott on Co-Op. It's always felt too expensive, but I've always put that down to the fact that textbooks are expensive, generally. And to think you can get it for just $52! The "Member's Price" is something like $52.90. I'd always harboured a suspicion that the actual retail price was the "Member's Price" and they just made you feel like you were making a saving when in fact they inflated the price on purpose, and charged $20 for the priviledge of paying a fair price. They can do that - there's no competition. Since you're likely to make a real saving buying online and you usually don't need a textbook until after the 2nd or 3rd week of class so can afford to wait for delivery, it seems better to buy online. I bet the reason they don't release the text lists until uni has started is so that people will be put off doing this (since they would have to wait two weeks for a delivery). Do you think I'm paranoid? What are your thoughts?*

Yes, you are paranoid. The Co-Op Bookshop is not entirely to blame. Often they don't get text lists from lecturers until fairly close to the beginning of term, and they can't order what they don't know about. Also, they don't always get accurate figures about student numbers, or how many copies to order. My sister used to work for the Co-Op, and I've heard many stories from their side of the fence.



they release what textbooks you'll need heaps early anyway! in my four and a half years at university i have never had a problem with getting a textbook bc i go in and get mine a couple weeks before classes start - no queues, and about a million copies of the book you want! 

That's my experience too. Even if there is no text list, you can pretty much tell what books will be used for which courses, just by checking the shelves. Of course, you have to be in Canberra several weeks before semester begins, so students from out of town are at a disadvantage.
