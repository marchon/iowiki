As an empiricist, David.Hume thinks (rightly) that ideas can only exist in the mind that follow from perceptions of things in the world. Ideas follow from experience.

He argues that when we observe the world, we can never observe causation. We can see one thing that occurs after another thing - but we can never actually see or observe in any way 'causation'.

In short, he rejects causation. He claims that causation is an invalid mental construct rather than something that actually happens in the universe (or, if it is something that happens in the universe, we have no evidence that goes to it). Hume replaces causation with the idea of constant conjunction. What we would typically count as evidence of causation is, in fact, evidence of constant conjunction. I.E, we always observe A following from B (A and B are in constant conjunction) but we can never truly say that A causes B.

This goes to what science is doing. Constant conjunction permits testable hypothesis and allows science to make predictions. But it removes the ability of science to explain the world (Beyond predictions being a form of explanation in themselves).

This link, inter alia, has some useful information on Hume and Causation.
