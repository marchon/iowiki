*red I agree that it's more efficient to target experiments at a theory (hypothesis), but Kuhn's stuff about paradigms (in the sense of disciplinary matrices) may be worth mentioning here.

I have a limited experience of what scientists actually do, but I think I agree with Greg.

I would say descriptively (of theoreticians and experimentalist - who can be, and often are, the same person) that theoreticians interpret the theories which underpin the paradigm and form hypotheses (i.e start asking the sorts of questions they're allowed to ask). Experimentalists interpret the hypotheses and design experiments to test them, and interpret the data from the experiments to (simply put) prove or disprove the hypothesis.

*pink In my limited experience of what scientists do, experimentalists are directed by theoreticians. Someone comes up with a theory, other people engage in experiments to prove or disprove it.

Normatively I think this is a very good idea. It's simply more efficient to target experiments at a theory, rather than blindly stumble into experiments and knit together a theory around them.

Regarding a ToE, I think it's both plausible and desirable for Einstein to be right. Plausible because countless times humans have come to gaps knowledge, and countless times we've filled them. When we arrive at a new gap it would be unusual to say _'oh no! It's gap, what ever shall will we do?!'_ 

It's desirable because, as an inquisitive human, I don't much like gaps in knowledge. Also it gives me good cause to bite my thumb at theists. Offending people, descriptively, makes me happy*

RE Lorenzo's Einstein quotes: I would like to think that scientists wouldn't be content to rest on their laurels, or on the laurels of the giants before them. I hope we aren't inclined to settle for "so loose and flimsy a description of nature". I think one of the most significant recurring themes in history of science is that every time scientists/philosophers thought they were approaching a comprehensive understanding of the world...they turned out to be wrong. It is possible that one day we will arrive at a TOE (theory of everything), I think. But I also think best-practice would be to continue to assume we haven't arrived there yet, even when we're inclined to think we have. Perhaps the most ardent proponents of the idea that we are nearing a TOE should take a lesson from Russell's chicken; next time we assume we have things right and act on those assumptions (subsequently discovered to be inductively derived falsehoods) we may just have our heads chopped off. Now, I don't have particular concerns about the upcoming experiments with CERN's LHC, however that may just be because I don't know enough about it, or the neccessary background to fully comprehend it. I just hope that misplaced confidence in the accuracy of scientific knowledge, and its technological applications, don't lead us down an unpleasant path.

[[[break]]]added at line 0: *lime {code Some one asked today why it was important that we review the different case studies of what scientists actually do and i wanted to venture an answer of my own. It especially relates to these examples of physics we've been looking it. I think these theories that are at the forefront of physics provide an especially vivid characterisation of what scientists actually do. 

I think in the examples of theoretical physics we've been looking at it is the easiest to see the real mechanism by which scientific knowledge expands. While it is a common view-point that scientists grow their theories by making lots of observations and then connecting the dots (Observations -> theory) I contented that in reality the opposite is going on. Real science starts with a theory (the creation of a theory is thus a vibrant and creative process) and then tries to falsify parts or all of that theory with empirical experience. If the theory is wrong they start again, if parts of it are wrong, they improve on their theory (Theory -> Observations -> Better theory, etc.). This is all Popper’s stuff and I'm sure we'll talk about this further on in the course so i won't waffle on too much here except to say that no where else can one find a better example of what i just described occurring in the real world than in the growth of quantum mechanics. A short read of the history of how all this stuff came about will demonstrate this I believe. 

A parting thought on all the stuff about Schrodinger's cat, i found a letter by Einstein to Popper, at the end of it Einstein says two inspiring things: 

Firstly, "An orthodox quantum theorist will say, of course, that there is no such thing as a complete description and that there can be only a statistical description of an aggregate of systems, rather than a description of one single system. But first of all, he ought to say so clearly; and secondly, i do not believe that we shall have to be satisfied for ever with so loose and flimsy a description of nature" (Almost brings a tear to my eye!)

And equally importantly "A method of description which, like the one now in use, is statistical in principle, can only be a passing phase, in my opinion"
