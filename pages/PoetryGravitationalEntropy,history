*green The idea of being more clumped must be seen in conjunction with what causes the clumping. There are many ways that gravity can cause a given mass to clump to a given configuration. These are what are called ``gravitational degrees of freedom''. If you can count the number of ways  you will get the gravitational entropy.


If a gas has nearly uniform density, it has not clumped at that time. So its gravitational entropy is low. This is believed to be the case at the big bang --- the density inhomogeneities
were small in the region of the universe that expanded to become our universe.  The gravitational degrees of freedom had not come into play at this point (in fact gravity becomes a separate force only a bit after the big bang --- see the lecture on the big bang).

As the universe expands, matter clumps into stars etc. and eventually into black holes.  The gravitational entropy increases during these processes.

The ideas presented in the lecture were not intended to be more complicated than this.

There are quantum treatments of black hole entropy which confirm these ideas, but they're not required for the course.

Hope this helps.

*red But why are the lecturers saying that things that are highly clumped have a lot of gravitational entropy? It does make sense that when all particles were in the same place that was zero entropy. Actually, if there was no choice about where the particles could be, was that really zero entropy? If something has a lot of choice about the way it can be, either all the gas in one corner or spread evenly, I can see that the former is low entropy, but is it still when the particles have no choice? I guess I don't understand enough about it to know, but, it does intrigue me.

Anyway, that was at risk of going off the topic of my question. Jason or Dayal, please answer in a way that clears this up. It's unfair to talk about a topic if you were never planning on letting us understand it in the first place!*

*blue Entropy comes from the Second Law of Thermodynamics: In any thermodynamic process that proceeds from one equilibrium state to another, the entropy of the system + environment either remains unchanged or increases.

Thus while the entropy of a system can decrease, that decrease must be accompanied by an increase in the environment.

For example this explains why gas fills a room with equal pressure throughout.

Entropy can be thought of in the same way as temperature or energy. It is a variable that can be measured in a system.

The first and second laws of thermodynamics combined tell us that the energy of the universe is constant and the entropy always increases. Entropy is considered as representing disorder, but this is only true if we define disorder in a quantifiable manner. 

Now when you throw gravitation into the mix, and thus general relativity I am out of the picture. Except to say that IF the world BEGAN with a singularity it would at that point be at its lowest amount of entropy, and from then entropy would have increased. However the energy has remained constant throughout. Thus explaining the expansion of the universe, measured by the red-shift.

Okay I am outta here!

p.s. I have a soft spot for entropy because my dad always told me my bedroom had alot of it.

I don't get it either...if something is highly 'clumped' how can it have more randomness?
Like, a glass of hot water has more entropy than say, a block of wood right?

[[[break]]]added at line 0: *lime {code What is gravitational entropy?

I got the idea from Dayal’s lecture that something with high gravitational entropy is more highly clumped, so has more arrangements of matter it could have come from.

I’m not sure if this is right, because he was not able to explain what it was when a student asked him what it meant.

If this is the case, why do we think that the instant of the big bang was a zero entropy state? Wouldn’t it have been the ultimate of high-entropy states, since everything was about as clumped as it could get?

Some quotes from Dayal’s lecture slides:

- The initial state of the universe was also a … perfectly ordered gravitational state … the greater the gravitational clumping, the larger the entropy.
- … it is the tendency of matter to clump and collapse … that results in the increase of entropy…
- … the universe started off with almost zero (gravitational) entropy.

And from Jason’s:

- … the big bang had very low gravitational entropy.

Aren’t these all in contradiction with one another? If not, what have I misunderstood?
