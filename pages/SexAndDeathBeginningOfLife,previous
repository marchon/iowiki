John L. Casti (2000), _Paradigms Regained: A Further Exploration of the Mysteries of Modern Science,_ contains a very good brief survey of the theories of how life on Earth began, and gives a lot of good references if you want to go deeper. It also discusses many other issues of interest to students of the philosophy of science/biology. Unfortunately, the ANU Library does not appear to hold a copy of this book, or Casti's earlier book, _Paradigms Lost._

He gives references to several survey papers that outline some of the competing theories and the problems that they face. For those interested, the references are:

->Baltscheffsky, H., et al. (1997). On the Origin and Evolution of Life: An Introduction. _J. Theor. Biol._ 187: 453-459.

->Pirie, N. (1994). The Origins of Life on Earth. _Interdisciplinary Science Reviews_ 19:13-21.

->De Duve, C. (1995). The Beginnings of Life on Earth. _American Scientist_ 83(September-October 1995): 428-437.

->Ruse, M. (1997). The Origin of Life: Philosophical Perspectives. _J. Theor. Biol._ 187: 473-482.

With a bit of luck you might be able to access these online through the ANU Library. I haven't yet tried to find them myself.

He also cites an article by Cairns-Smith, whom Jason mentioned in the tutorial as having proposed that life began in clay. The reference is: *red(I've just tried to look this up, but it's not available online through the Library. Bugger! It appears that there's not even a hard copy.)*

->Cairns-Smith, A.G. (1988). The Chemistry of Materials for Artificial Darwinian Systems. _Intl. Revs in Phys. Chem._ 7: 209-250.

Perhaps some of the chemists in the group can have a look at this and explain it to me!

Jason, 

Do I get brownie points for this? I need them, I think.

*blue You've already got brownie points for it once!  You don't get any more!  But don't worry.  You're doing fine for this semester's brownie points.  Jason*

*black So how do these brownie points work anyway? TeganLarter*

*blue You get them for contributing to the web site, and for contributing to tutorials, up to a maximum of 20% of the course mark.  The only reason Dick doesn't get them for this page is that he wrote it last year, and got brownie points then.  He does get them for what he's written on other pages.  Jason*

*red If brownie points correlate directly to content, how many brownie points would one get, say hypothetically, for drawing lame comic strips relating to course content?
