[[[break]]]added at line 0: *lime {code A link written in CamelCase links to the same place as the equivalent link written with a dot (e.g., CuteWombats and cute.wombats point to the same page).  This is to make it easy for people who like using dots and people who like using CamelCase to share the same wiki.  If CuteWombats pointed to one place and cute.wombats pointed to a different place then we'd end up with CamelCase apartheid: CamelCase people would end up writing on a different page from dot people.  But since CuteWombats and cute.wombats point to the same place that won't happen.
