[[[break]]]added at line 0: *lime {code ##Why informed consent regarding therapeutic decisions is impossible
(or at least very difficult)

# Background
Just about everyone agrees that a patient being prescribed a therapy should be given enough information regarding the likely benefits and harms of the therapy such that the patient can make an informed decision about whether they wish to take it.

While much of this debate has occurred in relation to informed consent for clinical trials the ethics is readily applicable to day-to-day therapeutic decision-making by healthcare professionals and patients.  If anything the problem is more acute in this setting because presumably we are supposed to have enough information in order to justify the use of the therapy for the patient.

# The problem
The key problem has been the question of how to express to patient the risks and benefits of the therapy in an objective as possible manner, i.e. without substantial framing from the health professional, while still communicating the inherent uncertainty present within all available information.

It seems that the bulk of the literature sees this as a problem of communicating complex information.  There is growing literature on how patients may be provided with information based on findings from RCTs such that something like informed consent can be achieved.  These approaches typically involve putting the results of trials, in particular NNT and NNH, into a format that aids communication.  One frequent approach is to display such numbers pictorially, e.g. for a RCT with NNT of 25 and NNH 50 you might display 100 faces and show four faces as happy (outcome prevented) and two faces as unhappy (adverse event experienced) and 94 faces a neutral.

# Redefining the problem

It seems that the problem could be rephrased as a problematic consequence of the metaphysical assumptions of classical statistics.  Essentially, classical analysis of RCTs is unable to provide the right kind of information for achieving informed consent.  I would argue that the kind of information required is probabilistic (in a different sense to what is provided by classical methods).

In short, I would argue that what decision-makers need is probabilistic information regarding therapeutic hypotheses i.e. rough conditional probabilities as well as ways to adjust these rough conditional probabilities for patients with differing clinical situations to those patients included in the trials.  Classical statistics does not provide this information
