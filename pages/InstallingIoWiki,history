*crimson No worries!  When you say "where to take it", do you mean where to download it?

*green Update: hooray.  You can get the interpreter from http://io.urbanape.com/release/IoFull-2005-10-17.tar.gz.   So now it makes sense for me to make IoWiki available here.  I'll do that as soon as I get around to it.  In the meantime, I'd be happy to email it to you, if you send me your email address.  * .Jason

[[[break]]]changed line 1 from: *orange {code I imagine that ..IoWiki runs on most versions of unix, although so far I've only tested it on ..MacOS X.  I hope that eventually it will run on every reasonably popular operating system.

- First, install Io by downloading it from http://www.iolanguage.com/Downloads/ and following the instructions that come with it.  If you already have Io then make sure it's a version from at least 23 January 2005.

- Download the ..IoWiki distribution from http://iowiki.sourceforge.net.  It will have a file name like IoWiki-n.n.tgz.  Unpack it by typing {code tar xfz IoWiki-n.n.tgz}

- Move the resulting directory to wherever you want it, and make it your working directory.

- Edit ..config.io to change the page template password and anything else you feel like changing.

- Try running ..IoWiki by typing {code IoServer IoWiki.io}

- If that doesn't work, make sure the Io program ..IoServer is on your PATH; or, edit the file ..IoWiki.io so that the first line points to the location of ..IoServer, make sure it's executable, and then type {code IoWiki.io}

- Now point a web browser at http://localhost:8080 (if your web browser is running on your web server; otherwise, replace ``localhost'' with your web server's address).

- After testing it for a while and making sure you're happy with it, you may prefer to run it in the background by typing {code nohup IoServer IoWiki.io &}
