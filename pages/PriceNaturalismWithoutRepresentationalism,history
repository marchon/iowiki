---> Not that philosophers should merely leave it to scientists to do the fleshing out (even if he takes that line at all, and I don't know whether he does).  Remember, from Quining Naturalism:
---> ``philosophy ... is not an activity `after' science, in a logical sense. In particular, it does not rely on inferences from what best current science says about reality. On the contrary, it is itself a kind of formal finishing school for scientific theory. Its own products ARE best current science.''

}*[[[break]]]to: *green {code -- Furthermore, semantic notions are often used as tools in metaphysical investigation (and thus if taken to be used in any "substantial" way (which, as Yablo has pointed out, is difficult to determine), one must assume the linguistic conception).
-- One possible strategy may be to adopt some material conception based on Lewis' casual description idea.
--- This is problematic if one denies that all objects of interest are causal.
--- Obviously, one cannot use the linguistic role as a replacement as then we are back to the linguistic conception.
--- Furthermore, if one tries to accommodate the above objection by allowing for many different roles to be used on a case by case basis, one runs into difficulties to do with justifying why each of these should be accepted in each case (similar to Lewis' "all causation is physical causation" premise).
- Finally, one can see that by removing the representationalist assumption and going with a subject naturalist approach, one reduces placement problems to puzzles regarding the origins of linguistic use.

An argument for subject naturalism (detailed below) over object naturalism on the basis of difficulties to with a representationalist view of language.

Price, H., Naturalism without representationalism in Naturalism in Question, Macarthur and de Caro (eds), Harvard University Press.

*How does it fit in?*

Points out more difficulties for the Quinean naturalist ontology.  Namely that it most likely must rest on some sort of representationalist principle (the derivation of which is no easy task).
