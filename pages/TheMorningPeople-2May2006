Hello,

For years, it has been believed that sarcasm is the lowest form of wit. However, after four years of research, scientists at the MacFisheries Institute of Higher Education (formerly Grimsby College) have announced that in recent years, a number of baser types have developed.

"Although sarcasm is not big or clever, it's a million times better than the sponsorship items that bookend the ad breaks in repeats of Inspector Morse," says their article in the Icelandic Journal of Cod Stock Studies. Video montages of quirky moments from the World Snooker Championships were rated "completely cack", while Channel Four's Avid Merrion was described as being "In a league of his own. Several divisions below everyone else." Global standards have exhibited a worrying decline over the last hundred years, with epigrams and bon mots at risk of complete extinction, and several other types of sophisticated humour in danger.

Personally, however, I like to think that if Oscar Wilde were alive today, he would abandon these old forms, and choose instead the medium of promotional emails for poorly attended events at the Man on the Moon. For instance, I'm sure the great man have wanted to tell the world about tomorrow night's singer-songwriter night, featuring as it does:

Ben Calvert and his band
Tom Coffee
Rowenna Wiseman
and more, for nothing.

He would also, doubtless, have been first in the queue for tickets to the Loft on Friday night for a very fine evening of Americana and country-folk. Headliner James Apollo (www.jamesapollo.com) is touring the UK from his home in Minnesota, and this is a rare chance to see a truly special talent. There's support from the Mark Drury Band (you might remember Mark as the frontman of local heroes Maker) and Clara Kousah, and it's a mere four quid to get in. The Loft is upstairs at the Graduate pub, Chesterton Road.

love Sam
