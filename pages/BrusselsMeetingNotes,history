Argument
Not sure that focussing the argument on pharmacogenomics is the best way forward…. Though it is a reasonable example

Really the argument now is how need should be defined---assuming that public health systems do exist to provide access to treatment according to need

"How is this different from subgroups in trials” the reply (should have been)---If subgroups from trials have the same need (as I have defined it) then it is not different.  If different need then different treatment is justified.
Some confusion with how I had defined need; economist preference for need as capacity to benefit from healthcare by cost.  This seems to lead directly to a sole focus on efficiency.
The paper, if there is a paper in this, is on how equity concerns are obfuscated by how need is defined (i.e. capacity to benefit from healthcare per $).

A second paper---closer to the PhD---is in regard to the problems which current RCT analysis (focused on classical statistics) presents a problem for sound economic analysis.  A number of presentations relied on bayesian approaches but are hampered, I think, by the clinical efficacy inputs being that of classical statistics.  There is also a second issue around finding evidence for pharmacogenomic/genomic technologies, by their nature they are not amenable to classical statistics.
