*What is it?*

Crispin Wright's sketch of the realism battlefield.  It's of particular relevance as he has directly responded to Dummett.

*Where can it be found?*

Wright, C. Realism, Meaning & Truth, 2nd ed.

*Summary*

- Realism: 
-- able to form the right concepts re: features of the world
-- can come to know true statements about the world (involving the above concepts)
- Scepticism: doesn't dispute existence, rather ability to grasp truths.
- Idealism: realist misunderstands nature of truth, it is all of our own making.
- Dummett as still concerned with misunderstandings re: truth but not in all cases.
- at issue: can truth transcend evidence?
- how does this connect to traditional realist debates?
-- i.e. how does it lead to a questioning of the fit of our beliefs with the world?
--- seems we can have this fit without transcendence
- Dummett: key point is that realist believes in unrestricted bivalence.
-- how then is the realist to account for vagueness?
-- doesn't seem they can, so perhaps a more reasonable characterisation of the realist is via their belief in ..evidence-transcendence (ET) with bivalence coming in when vagueness is not an issue?
-- *crimson [I don't know this book but] surely that last point must be right: nobody believes in totally unrestricted bivalence.  Nobody believes that ``(blibble) v ( ~ blibble)''. Jason*
- but not at all clear that scientific realist is stuck with ET
-- *crimson But since ``scientific realist'' means something different from ``realist'', that MIGHT not help.  Or it might help, if you mean a particularly strong kind of scientific realist who is like a traditional realist.  Or if scientific realism is what you're concerned with.  (Not sure whether ``you'' is Wilcox or Wright.  Either way.)  Jason*
- 3 kinds of objectivity:
-- truth: may have intelligibility without having cognitive capacity to determine ..truth-value
-- meaning: meaning of a statement as a real constraint
--- note: obj truth => obj meaning but maybe not <=
-- judgement: statements that are attempting to deal with independent features of the world (i.e. outcome of judgements not entirely determined by the judge)
--- again obj truth => obj judgement
