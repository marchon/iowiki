*Design of social inventions: the case of ``evidence'' in health policy*

We're interested in evidence.  A bit of a sociological history: evidence has been used as a means of improving research quality.  Governments are interested in this.

New ideas in research management have a life cycle, starting off by being radical and then becoming routinised and absorbed.

At the moment, a big policy focus is evidence-based medicine, both as an aspiration and as the title of a particular approach to evidence.  The question is whether the standardised system of which this is the title fully meets the aspirations of the ideal.  

We plan to lay the foundations of a system analogous to the system for describing uncertainty already in use at the Dutch Environmental Agency (& NUSAP)

The analysis of different sorts of ``evidence'' in different fora.  How do they relate?  Are they compatible?
