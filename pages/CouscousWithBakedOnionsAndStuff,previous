cous cous
baked onions and zucchinis (or fried if you're in a hurry)
peppercorns
thyme (if you've got any)
maybe corn?

sometimes preserved lemons

try serving with harissa and maybe arrabiata and the following:

2 Tbsp (15g) cornstarch

1/2 cup (120mL) cold water

1 Tbsp (15mL) sesame oil

2 cloves garlic, minced

1 1/2 cups (360mL) orange juice

1/2 cup (120mL) soy sauce

- Mix cornstarch and cold water together in a jar, shake until blended. In a small saucepan over medium heat, heat oil and add garlic, sauté for one minute. Add orange juice, soy sauce and honey/sugar and heat. When thoroughly heated, add cornstarch mixture to sauce and turn heat up to bring about a slow rolling boil. Using a whisk, stir sauce frequently until it thickens. (adapted from http://www.evitamins.com/healthnotes.asp?ContentID=2555007)
