Excerpt from De Principiis Non Disputandum
Herbert Feigl
Published in Philosophical Analysis, ed. Max Black (Cornell University Press, 1950).

A dense but interesting read about the problem of induction, the problems of formal logic, and possible justifications of the adoption of the rule of induction...
