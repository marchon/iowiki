If you don't already know any of Jerry's other books (most famous of which is "Scientific Knowledge and its Social Problems"), you can find a brief biography at http://www.martininstitute.ox.ac.uk/JMI/People/fellows/Ravetz+Jerry.htm.

The workshop organisers are Jason Grossman, Joan Leach (University of Queensland) and Adam La Caze (University of Sydney).  Funding and administrative support are kindly being provided by the Biohumanities Program, University of Queensland (main sponsor) and by the Centre for Time, University of Sydney.

One of the main purposes of this workshop will be to discuss an application for an ARC linkage grant on evidence-based medicine which I'm hoping to submit in 2007.
