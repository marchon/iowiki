There are several candidate methods for making the abstract/concrete distinction.

In much the same way that one electron is held to be instantiated here and another there according to many theories.  However, the analogy differs when one considers the level at which existence in posited in each instance.  In the case of the electron, there is no temptation (*green or is there? maybe I need to weaken this? - Jason?*) to claim the existence of the \emph{type} "electron."  However, this is exactly what many (if not most) Platonists \emph{would} wish to claim was the case in the mathematical context.  Thus what has emerged is a sort of cline~\footnote{A cline is an axis along which one may map out points with having to posit some underlying continuum - a much better model for many philosophical debates.} of ways in which one may satisfy the abstractness desiderata in more or less controversial ways: from fully-fledged abstractness properties such as causal inertness at one extreme of controversiality to multiple-instantiability at the other.  What I argue that Colyvan must do in order to satisfy the Platonist and cause problems for the scientific realist is place his mathematical objects on his cline.  However, it is not at all clear that the QOM provides him with the tools necessary to do so.
}*[[[break]]]to: *green {code As Rosen observes~\footnote{\citet{Rosen:2006}} there is as yet no standard philosophical account of the difference between abstract and concrete objects.  However, as he also points out, if anything is to be considered an abstract object, then it is generally acknowledged that mathematical objects should be so considered.  Thus, if the abstractness property exists (and it is a widely held view that it does), then mathematical objects must possess it.  

There are several potential methods via which the abstract/concrete distinction may be made.  Given that my primary concern is with the abstractness of mathematical objects more generally conceived, I will limit my discussion here to a brief sketch a few of the more popular options (so as to convey a general idea of the sorts of properties commonly subsumed under the heading of abstractness): firstly, one may claim that abstract objects are non-spatiotemporal (i.e. that they exist outside of space and time); secondly, they may be held to be causally inert (i.e. unable to cause change to occur in the physical world); finally, abstract objects may be defined by considering a process of abstraction applied to concrete objects (such as that proposed by Locke or the more recent Fregean conception put forward by Hale and Wright - note that such a process should not necessarily be interpreted as the process via which such objects are brought into existence, it may just as easily be interpreted as the process via which we come to intuit their existence).  It should be acknowledged that all of the conceptions discussed have been subject to serious objections and as such any conception of mathematical objects involving them should be considered to be uncontroversial.  

However,there is a possible way of addressing the common intuition behind the abstractness desideratum in a more minimal way: namely, via the claim that mathematical objects should be multiply-instantiable - i.e. they should be types rather than tokens.

By multiple instantiability here I mean that the \emph{same} mathematical entity (consider a particular Abelian group for example) should be able to posited to exist instantiated in one theory here and in another theory there.  A useful analogy can be drawn here to a more tangible scientific object type such as a hydrogen atom. According to most theories the hydrogen atom type is held to be multiply-instantiated in various molecules (i.e. the molecules involve different tokens of the same type).  However, the analogy with mathematical objects differs in an important way: with regard to the level at which existence is posited.  In the case of the hydrogen atom, it is generally held that only the particular hydrogen atom tokens exist, not the hydrogen atom type; whereas in the mathematical case type-level existence is exactly what many (if not most) Platonists \emph{would} wish to claim was the case.  Again, this claim certainly could not be said to be uncontroversial (although it is almost certainly a less controversial claim that any of the other particular abstractness claims above) but it does help one to develop a feel for the scope of ways in which the abstractness desiderata may be satisfied.

What has begun to emerge from the discussion above is a sort of cline~\footnote{A cline is an axis that is not necessarily a continuum - a more accurate model for many philosophical debates.} along which one may place ways of satisfying the abstractness desiderata, ordered in terms of the level of controversy one would court by holding such a view: from the fully-fledged abstractness properties such as causal inertness at one extreme to multiple-instantiability at the other.  What I argue that Colyvan must do (and has not done) in order to develop a position that at least has a chance of  satisfying the Platonist and causing problems for the scientific realist, is place his mathematical objects somewhere on his cline.  However, as we shall see, it is not at all clear that the Quinean ontological machine provides him with the tools necessary to do so.

}*[[[break]]]to: *green {code - key point from first chapter: reification does not necessarily mean that all properties come too
- and unclear as to how to cut this off in a principled way in this context
- ?some problematic e.g.s here?
- so what properties are we guaranteed will come from the QOM?
- those that are involved in our best scientific theories?
- but not all properties are involved in our best scientific theories
- most crucially, difficult to see how abstractness properties are involved
- hence doesn't look like one can get our objects that would be considered to be properly mathematical by many

response 1:
- could argue that it is mathematical practice that obtains priviledged status via maths' involvement in our best sci. theories
- and this practice involves commitment to abstractness in some sense
- but does this really gel with the Quinean view? seems that we have moved away from science being used to investigate the nature of the world here
- unless one considers maths to be science
- but then what did we need involvement in our best scientific theories for in the first place? our best mathematical theories would just be members of the set of our best scientific ones
- and we end up with a different sort of argument for Platonism:
--> 1. We should believe in things that are indispensable to our best scientific practice
--> 2. Mathematics is part of our best scientific practice
--> 3. Mathematical entities are indispensable for mathematics
--> 4. Therefore we should believe in mathematical entities
- and many (including some Platonists and scientific realists) would probably wish to question 1 and 2
- also does not necessarily get all abstractness properties (certainly gets multiple-instantiability but unclear as to status of others)

response 2:
- one should somehow "cut off" the level at which indispensability is assessed to the "outside" of objects
- but what about when mathematical objects are overdescribed?
-- point-set topology vs algebraic topology
-- different axiomatisations of set theory
- and what about simplifications/idealisations
- are all of these properties reified?
- or are some of them just not our "best" scientific theories?

Rather what the QOM creates should be more accurately termed mathematico-scientific objects, objects that are better seen as a subset of the set of scientific objects.  Given this, it is no wonder that the scientific realist has difficulties avoiding the conclusion of Colyvan's argument: anything property via which the scientific realist might try to get a ``grip'' on mathematical entities in order to rule them out of the class of existing objects has been stripped away.  To give up the existence of these anemic mathematico-scientific entities would be to give up the existence of all scientific entities.

This argument may be weakened, and made less controversial, by eliminating the involvement of essentialism and instead claiming that abstractness is just some (possibly accidental) property of mathematical objects (the absence of which need not necessarily entail that the object is no longer a mathematical one).  On this view then, the scientific realist would claim that it is indeed strange that the abstractness property is \emph{never} instantiated under the Quinean model.  Accordingly, it seems that at the very least Colyvan owes the scientific realist who holds this view more of an explanation as why this property is never instantiated.

Given this state of affairs, how might the scientific realist can about mounting a defense of their anti-Platonism?

One plausible defense can take both strong and weak forms.  I will first go through the strong defense in detail before discussing how it can be weakened (possibly in order to make it less controversial).

[[[break]]]added at line 17: *lime {code By multiple instantiability here I mean that the \emph{same} mathematical entity should be able to posited to exist instantiated in one theory here and in another theory there.  In much the same way that one electron is held to be instantiated here and another there according to many theories.  However, the analogy differs when one considers the level at which existence in posited in each instance.  In the case of the electron, there is no temptation (*green or is there? maybe I need to weaken this? - Jason?*) to claim the existence of the \emph{type} "electron."  However, this is exactly what many (if not most) Platonists \emph{would} wish to claim was the case in the mathematical context.  Thus what has emerged is a sort of cline~\footnote{A cline is an axis along which one may map out points with having to posit some underlying continuum - a much better model for many philosophical debates.} of ways in which one may satisfy the asbtractness desiderata in more or less controversial ways: from fully-fledged abstractness properties such as causal inertness at one extreme of controversiality to multiple-instantiability at the other.  What I argue that Colyvan must do in order to satisfy the Platonist and cause problems for the scientific realist is place his mathematical objects on his cline.  However, it is not at all clear that the QOM provides him with the tools necessary to do so.
