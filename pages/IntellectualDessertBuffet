IDB - Intellectual Dessert Buffet - is the methodology you have when you're not having a methodology.  It's the way you do research when what you're most interested in is your topic rather than career brownie points.  It's picking and choosing what you feel like at the time.  It's loading up your plate with so much delicious goo that it becomes a mush by the time you get back to your table.

IDB is similar to IntellectualSmorgasbord, except that the latter seems to concentrate on variety of topics, while [=IDB=] concentrates on one '''topic''' but uses a variety of '''methods'''.

There might turn out to be important links between [[http://www-csli.stanford.edu/~john/procrastination.html Structured Procrastination]]  and Intellectual Dessert Buffet.  See also Jason. MuddleYourWayToSuccess.

I'm still not sure that using IDB is a wise career move!

This might be worth a journalistic sort of paper.
