[[[break]]]deleted at line 5: *red {code * If you're a Terminal-phobe you can run ..IoWiki by opening its file in the Finder, but to do so you have to not only follow the instructions at AdministratorDocumentation but also:
** choose Terminal as the application to open it with ... and to do that, you have to:
*** choose “Other” from the “Open with” pop-up menu in a file info window, and then
*** (less obviously) choose “Enable: All Applications” in the subsequent “Choose Other Application” dialog
